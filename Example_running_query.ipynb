Compounds 13, 16, felodipine and nimodipine are highly lipophilic (Kp = 227, 344, 442 and 187, respectively). The C-2 CH2OCH2CH2OH compound (13) exhibited equipotent anticonvulsant activity to nimodipine in the maximal electroshock (MES) anticonvulsant screen. Unlike nimodipine, 13 provided modest protection in the subcutaneous metrazol (scMet) anticonvulsant screen. In contrast, compound 16 was inactive in both the MES and scMet screens.</td>\n",

       "      <td> New analogues of nifedipine, in which the ortho-nitro phenyl group at position 4 has been replaced by 4(5)-chloro-5(4)-imidazolyl substituent and which are able to interact with the receptor by hydrogen binding were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as calcium channel antagonists. The designed dihydropyridines were synthesized using the Hantzsch condensation and evaluated as calcium channel antagonists using the high K+ contraction of guineapig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle. A docking study was performed using the AutoDock4 program, and QSAR equations were obtained using multilinear regression. Our computational studies indicated that the oxygen of the ester (O10) and the N3' of the imidazole ring form a hydrogen bonding interaction with the NH of HIS 363 and NH of LYS354, respectively, and that the sum of the BEHp5 and RDF075p are the most significant descriptors. The results of calcium channel antagonist evaluation demonstrated that increasing the chain length in C3 and C5 ester substituents increased activity. The most potent compound was the bis-phenylpropyl ester (5l) derivative, in that it was more active than the reference drug nifedipine and that the bis-phenylethyl ester (5k) derivative had comparable activity with nifedipine. The present research revealed that the 4(5)-chloro-5(4)-imidazolyl moiety is a bioisoster of o-nitrophenyl in nifedipine and provided novel dihydropyridines with more activity as calcium channel antagonists.</td>\n",

       "2                                                                                  3-Ethyl 5-methyl 1,4-dihydro-2-[(2-hydroxyethoxy) methyl]-6-methyl-4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate (13), a bioisostere of amlodipine, was prepared by the reaction of ethyl 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)acetoacetate (11) with methyl 2-(2,3-dichlorobenzylidene)acetoacetate (12) and NH4OAc. Compound 13 was elaborated to the target product 3-ethyl 5-methyl 1,4-dihydro-2-[2- [(1-methyl-1,4-dihydropyridyl-3-carbonyloxy)ethoxy]methyl]- 6-methyl-4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate (16). The C-2 CH2OCH2CH2OH compound (13, IC50 = 6.56 x 10(-9) M) was about 44-fold more active as a calcium channel antagonist than the reference drug nimodipine (IC50 = 1.49 x 10(-8) M), but 4-fold less potent than felodipine (IC50 = 1.45 x 10(-9) M). Compound 16, possessing the 1-methyl-3-pyridylcarbonyloxy chemical delivery system moiety is a slightly less potent calcium channel antagonist (IC50 = 2.99 x 10(-8) M) than the parent compound 13. Compounds 13, 16, felodipine and nimodipine are highly lipophilic (Kp = 227, 344, 442 and 187, respectively). The C-2 CH2OCH2CH2OH compound (13) exhibited equipotent anticonvulsant activity to nimodipine in the maximal electroshock (MES) anticonvulsant screen. Unlike nimodipine, 13 provided modest protection in the subcutaneous metrazol (scMet) anticonvulsant screen. In contrast, compound 16 was inactive in both the MES and scMet screens.   \n",
       "3  New analogues of nifedipine, in which the ortho-nitro phenyl group at position 4 has been replaced by 4(5)-chloro-5(4)-imidazolyl substituent and which are able to interact with the receptor by hydrogen binding were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as calcium channel antagonists. The designed dihydropyridines were synthesized using the Hantzsch condensation and evaluated as calcium channel antagonists using the high K+ contraction of guineapig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle. A docking study was performed using the AutoDock4 program, and QSAR equations were obtained using multilinear regression. Our computational studies indicated that the oxygen of the ester (O10) and the N3' of the imidazole ring form a hydrogen bonding interaction with the NH of HIS 363 and NH of LYS354, respectively, and that the sum of the BEHp5 and RDF075p are the most significant descriptors. The results of calcium channel antagonist evaluation demonstrated that increasing the chain length in C3 and C5 ester substituents increased activity. The most potent compound was the bis-phenylpropyl ester (5l) derivative, in that it was more active than the reference drug nifedipine and that the bis-phenylethyl ester (5k) derivative had comparable activity with nifedipine. The present research revealed that the 4(5)-chloro-5(4)-imidazolyl moiety is a bioisoster of o-nitrophenyl in nifedipine and provided novel dihydropyridines with more activity as calcium channel antagonists.   \n",

A docking study was performed using the AutoDock4 program, and QSAR equations were obtained using multilinear regression. Our computational studies indicated that the oxygen of the ester (O10) and the N3' of the imidazole ring form a hydrogen bonding interaction with the NH of HIS 363 and NH of LYS354, respectively, and that the sum of the BEHp5 and RDF075p are the most significant descriptors.

The most potent <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> was the bis-phenylpropyl ester (5l) derivative, in that it was more active than the reference drug nifedipine and that the bis-phenylethyl ester (5k) derivative had comparable activity with nifedipine. The present research revealed that the 4(5)-chloro-5(4)-imidazolyl moiety is a bioisoster of o-nitrophenyl in nifedipine and provided novel dihydropyridines with more activity as <span class=\"bio\">calcium channel</span> antagonists.</td>\n",

In this study, 18 novel asymmetrical DHPs bearing 3-pyridyl methyl carboxylate and alkyl carboxylate moieties at C3 and C5 positions, respectively, as well as nitrophenyl or hetero aromatic rings at C4 were synthesized and tested for MDR reversal with the aim of establishing a structure-activity relationship (SAR) for these agents. Effect of these <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> on P-gp mediated MDR was assessed in P-gp over-expressing MES-SA/DX5 doxorubicin resistant cells by flow cytometric detection of rhodamine 123 efflux. MDR reversal was further examined as the alteration of doxorubicin׳s <span class=\"chem\">IC50</span> in MES-SA/DX5 cells in the presence of DHPs by MTT assay and was compared to nonresistant MES-SA cells. Direct anticancer effect was examined against 4 human cancer cells including HL-60, K562, MCF-7 and LS180. <span class=\"bio\">Calcium channel</span> blocking (CCB) activity was also measured as a potential side effect. Most DHPs, particularly <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> bearing 3-nitrophenyl (A2B2 and A3B2) and 4-nitrophenyl (A3B1 and A4B1) moieties at C4 significantly inhibited rhodamine 123 efflux at 5-25µM, showing that the mechanism of MDR reversal by these agents is P-gp transporter modulation. Same derivatives were also able to selectively lower the resistance of MES-SA/DX5 to doxorubicin. A2B2 bearing ethyl carboxylate at C5 had also high direct antitumoral effect (<span class=\"chem\">IC50</span> range: 3.77-15.60μM). Our findings suggest that SAR studies of DHPs may lead to the discovery of novel MDR reversal agents.</td>\n",

In this project a group of alkyl ester <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> of new derivatives of nifedipine, in which the ortho-nitrophenyl group at position 4 is replaced by a 1-methyl-5-nitro-2-imidazolyl substituent, and the methyl group at position 6 is replaced by a phenyl substituent, were synthesized and evaluated as <span class=\"bio\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> using the high K+ contraction of guinea-pig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle. The results for asymmetrical esters showed that lengthening of the substituent in C3 ester substituent increased activity. When increasing of the length is accompanied by increasing the hindrance, the activity decreased.

Here, we enlarge the diversity of <span class=\"chem\">chemical</span> decorations, present the synthesis and in vitro data for 11 new derivatives, and develop a new 3D-QSAR model with recent in silico techniques. We observed a key role played by the oxadiazolone moiety: given the presence of positively charged <span class=\"bio\">calcium</span> ions in the transmembrane <span class=\"bio\">channel</span> protein, we hypothesize the formation of a ternary complex between the oxadiazolothiazinone, the Ca2+ ion and the protein. We have supported this hypothesis by means of pharmacophore generation and through the docking of the pharmacophore into a homology model of the protein. We also studied with docking experiments the interaction with a homology model of P-glycoprotein, which is inhibited by this series of <span class=\"chem\">molecules</span>, and provided further evidence toward the relevance of this scaffold in biological interactions.</td>\n",

We describe herein a variety of long-lived receptor-specific agonists and antagonists for LPA receptors. Several LPA and PA (phosphatidic acid) <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> also inhibit LPP (lipid phosphate phosphatase). The sn-1 or sn-2 hydroxy groups have been replaced by fluorine, difluoromethyl, difluoroethyl, O-methyl or O-hydroxyethoxy groups to give non-migrating LPA <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> that resist acyltransferases. Alkyl ether replacement of acyl esters produced lipase and acyltransferase-resistant <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span>. Replacement of the bridging oxygen in the monophosphate by an alpha-monofluoromethylene-, alpha-bromomethylene- or alpha,alpha-difluoromethylenephosphonate gave phosphatase-resistant <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span>. Phosphorothioate <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> with O-acyl and O-alkyl chains are potent, long-lived agonists for LPA1 and LPA3 receptors. Most recently, we have (i) prepared stabilized O-alkyl <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> of lysobisphosphatidic acid, (ii) explored the structure-activity relationship of stabilized cyclic LPA <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> and (iii) synthesized neutral head group trifluoromethylsulphonamide <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> of LPA. Through collaborative studies, we have collected data for these stabilized <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> as selective LPA receptor (ant)agonists, LPP inhibitors, TREK (transmembrane <span class=\"bio\">calcium channel</span>) K+ <span class=\"bio\">channel</span> agonists, activators of the nuclear transcription factor PPAR-gamma (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma), promoters of cell motility and survival, and radioprotectants for human B-cells.</td>\n",

We utilized a functional assay to measure NMDAR <span class=\"bio\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> using (45)Ca(2+) influx into synaptoneurosomes. The cage amine 8-benzylamino-8,11-oxapentacyclo[5.4.0.0(2,6). 0(3,10).0(5,9)]undecane (NPG1-01) proved to be the most potent experimental <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> with an <span class=\"chem\">IC(50</span>) of 2.98microM, while 8-amino-pentacyclo[5.4.0.0(2,6).0(3,10).0(5,9)]undecane had the next most potent <span class=\"chem\">IC(50</span>) of 4.06microM. Increasing the polycyclic cage size of NGP1-01 from a pentacycloundecane to a tridecane cage structure, but retaining the N-benzyl moiety decreased <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> 10-fold, indicating a limitation on the volume of the cage that can be accommodated in the <span class=\"bio\">channel</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site. In the presence of NGP1-01, NMDA/glycine-induced maximal (45)Ca(2+) influx was attenuated by 34% with an insignificant effect on agonist <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>.

It binds with high <span class=\"other_terms\">affinity</span> to the alpha(2)-delta subunit of <span class=\"bio\">voltage-gated calcium</span> <span class=\"bio\">channels</span> and is a substrate of the system L neutral amino acid transporter. A series of pregabalin <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> were prepared and evaluated for their alpha(2)-delta <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">affinity</span> as demonstrated by their ability to inhibit <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of [(3)H]gabapentin to pig brain membranes and for their <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> to inhibit the uptake of [(3)H]leucine into CHO cells, a measure of their ability to compete with the endogenous substrate at the system L transporter. <span class=\"chem\">Compounds</span> were also assessed in vivo for their ability to promote anxiolytic, analgesic, and anticonvulsant actions. These studies suggest that distinct structure activity relationships exist for alpha(2)-delta <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> and system L transport inhibition. However, both interactions appear to play an important role in the in vivo profile of these <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span>.</td>\n",
