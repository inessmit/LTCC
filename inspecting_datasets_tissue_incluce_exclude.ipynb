The <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> synthesized were evaluated for <span class=\"IC50s\"><span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> activity</span> against both N-type and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> focusing on selectivity to reduce <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> side effects due to <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. In the course of screening of our <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> library, N-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-L-aspartic acid derivative 1a was identified as an initial lead <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> for a new series of N-type <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span>, which inhibited <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> influx into IMR-32 <span class=\"species\">human</span> neuroblastoma cells with an IC(50) of 3.4 microM. <span class=\"chem\">Compound</span> 1a also exhibited <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of N-type <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> current in <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> experiment using IMR-32 cells (34% inhibition at 10 microM, n=3). As a consequence of conversion of amino acid residue of 1a, <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> 12a, that include N-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-L-cysteine, was found to be a potent N-type <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> with an IC(50) of 0.61 microM. Thus, L-cysteine was selected as a potential structural motif for further modification. Optimization of C- and N-terminals of L-cysteine using S-cyclohexylmethyl-L-cysteine as a central scaffold led to potent and selective N-type <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> 21f, which showed improved <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> (IC(50) 0.12 microM) and 12-fold selectivity for N-type <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> over <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.</td>\n",

The manuscript describes the design, synthesis, and biological testing of a total of 10 S-(p-methoxybenzyl), N-substituted thiosalicylamides as a series of non-cyclic <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> derived from <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>'s structure. The new <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> maintained all <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> pharmacophores except the thiazepine ring system. In vitro evaluation of the new series for <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effects revealed moderate activities with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values in the range of 4.8-56.0 microM. The data suggest that the ring system is not essential for activity; however, its absence leads to a considerable drop of activity relative to that of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>=0.3 microM). <span class=\"chem\">Compounds</span> of the current series showed optimum activity when the aliphatic alkyl chain on the salicylamide nitrogen is part of a <span class=\"chemicals\">piperidine</span> or piperazine ring system substituted at the terminal nitrogen with a benzyl group.</td>\n",

Here the new <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> derivatives Bay E5759 (1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid ethyl-1-methylethyl ester) and Bay A4339 (1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid dimethyl-ester) were tested for their <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> and selectivity of <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> of Ba(2+)currents mediated by low-(LVACC)vs high-voltage activated <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+)channels</span> (HVACC) in neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cells. <span class=\"chemicals\">Nisoldipine</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> served as reference <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span>. Bay E5759 and Bay A4339 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> HVACC at low nanomolar concentrations, whereas LVACC was hardly reduced at up to 10 microM. The order of <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> for <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of HVACC was Bay E5759 (IC(50): 0.4 nM) > Bay A4339 (2.5 nM) approximately = <span class=\"chemicals\">nisoldipine</span> (4 nM) >> <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> (3.8 microM). Thus Bay E5759 and Bay A4339 are highly potent and selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> of HVACC, presumably <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+)channels</span>.</td>\n",

Since it was not known whether the effect on multi-drug resistance was also enantioselective a comparison has been made of the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of the R and S enantiomers and racemic <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> in their ability to increase the cytotoxicity of vincristine and daunomycin in sensitive (MOLT 4B) and drug resistant <span class=\"species\">human</span> T-lymphoma cell lines (MOLT/VCR-5 x 9, MOLT/DAU-8 and VCR 1000, a highly resistant subline of CCRF-CEM). Two major metabolites, <span class=\"chemicals\">norverapamil</span> and D617 were tested in the same system. (+)-R, (-)-S-, racemic <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">norverapamil</span> and D617 alone had no effect on cell growth in sensitive or resistant cell lines in concentrations up to 20 microM. In combination with vincristine, <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">norverapamil</span> but not D617 produced a concentration dependent increase in the sensitivity of the resistant lines. Racemic <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, its individual enantiomers and <span class=\"chemicals\">norverapamil</span> were equipotent. The concentration of the modifiers required to elicit 50% of the maximum effect (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>) was of the order of 0.5 microM. No significant difference in the slopes of the concentration-effect curves were observed. The effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">norverapamil</span> was additive. In the sensitive MOLT 4B cell line both enantiomers and <span class=\"chemicals\">norverapamil</span> increased sensitivity towards vincristine. However, the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values were at least an order of magnitude higher (2.5-8 microM) than in the resistant cell lines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>\n",

The drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of these drugs for the hOCT/rOct-mediated hepatic/renal uptake process was also assessed. The IC(50) values of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> drugs, including an I(f) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> with a new mechanism of action, were greater for hOCT2/rOct2 than those for hOCT1/rOct1 or hOCT3/rOct3. No species differences in these values were observed between hOCTs and rOcts. As for hOCT2-mediated uptake, the IC(50) values of <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span> and the I(f) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> for metformin uptake were lower than those for MPP uptake. However, previous clinical studies found that the IC(50) values of these drugs for hOCT1/rOct1 and hOCT2/rOct2 were much greater than their unbound plasma concentrations, which suggests that the DDIs of these cationic <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> may not be related to hOCT/rOct-mediated hepatic/renal uptake pathways. In addition, investigation of the luminal transporters of cationic <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> in the kidney, as well as the in vitro DDI potential of their <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span>, is important for the clarification of cationic <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> DDIs in humans.</td>\n",

The pharmacological profile of the ATP-induced increase in ICa amplitude and of ATP activation of a non-specific cationic current, IATP, was investigated in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells. 2. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values for ICa increase and IATP activation were 0.36 microM and 0.76 microM respectively. Suramin (10 microM) and cibacron blue (1 microM) competitively antagonized both effects of ATP. 3. The rank order of efficacy and <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of ATP <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> in increasing ICa amplitude was 2-methylthio-ATP approximately ATP approximately ATP gamma S. The derivatives alpha,beta-methylene-ATP, beta,gamma-methylene-ATP and beta,gamma-imido-ATP up to 500 microM had no significant effects. 4. The rank order of efficacy of ATP <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> in activating a non-specific cationic current, IATP, was 2-methylthio-ATP > ATP >> ATP gamma S. The rank order of <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> was 2-methylthio-ATP approximately ATP. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of ATP gamma S could not be determined owing to its very low efficacy. 5. The ATP <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> alpha,beta-methylene-ATP, beta,gamma-methylene-ATP and beta,gamma-imido-ATP at 500 microM did not activate IATP but acted as <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> of activation of IATP by ATP. 6. The results suggest that the increase in ICa amplitude induced by external ATP is due to activation of P2Y-purinoceptors. 7. The mechanism of IATP activation remains to be determined before the receptor subtype involved can be deduced.</td>\n",

We used the whole-cell, <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique at room temperature to investigate the effects of ACA on the Ca(2+)-activated chloride current (I(Cl(Ca))) and other chloride currents in isolated <span class=\"species\">pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. ACA reversibly inhibited I(Cl(Ca)) in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)=4.2 μM, n(Hill)=1.1), without affecting the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current. Unlike ACA, the non-selective PLA(2) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> bromophenacyl bromide (BPB; 50 μM) had no effect on I(Cl(Ca)). In addition, the analgesic NSAID structurally-related to ACA, <span class=\"chemicals\">diclofenac</span> (50 μM) also had no effect on I(Cl(Ca)), whereas the current in the same cells could be suppressed by chloride <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> flufenamic acid (FFA; 100 μM) or 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS;100 μM). Besides I(Cl(Ca)), ACA (50 μM) also suppressed the cAMP-activated chloride current, but to a lesser extent. It is proposed that the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects of ACA on I(Cl(Ca)) are PLA(2)-independent and that the drug may serve as a useful tool in understanding the nature and function of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> anion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.</td>\n",

The <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> tested inhibited daunorubicin-augmented lipid peroxidation and O2 consumption to varying degrees. Inhibition of daunorubicin-stimulated lipid peroxidation was found to be dose dependent; the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> (drug concentration producing 50% inhibition of lipid peroxidation) values for <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> were approximately 150 microM, 200 microM, and 600 microM respectively.

In this study, we report the discovery of 3-nitro-N-(4-phenoxyphenyl) benzamide (ICA-105574), a potent and efficacious hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activator with a unique mechanism of action. In whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> studies of recombinant hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, ICA-105574 steeply potentiated current amplitudes more than 10-fold with an EC(50) value of 0.5 +/- 0.1 microM and a Hill slope (n(H)) of 3.3 +/- 0.2. The effect on hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> was confirmed because the known hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span>, N-[4-[[1-[2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]carbonyl]phenyl]methanesulfonamide, 2HCl (<span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span>) and BeKm-1, potently <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the stimulatory effects of ICA-105574. The primary mechanism by which ICA-105574 potentiates hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity is by removing hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> inactivation, because ICA-105574 (2 microM) shifts the midpoint of the voltage-dependence of inactivation by >180 mV from -86 to +96 mV. In addition to the effects on inactivation, greater concentrations of ICA-105574 (3 microM) produced comparatively small hyperpolarizing shifts (up to 11 mV) in the voltage-dependence of <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activation and a 2-fold slowing of <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> deactivation. In isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes, ICA-105574 induced a concentration-dependent shortening of action potential duration (>70%, 3 microM) that could be prevented by preincubation with <span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span>. In conclusion, we identified a novel agent that can prevent the inactivation of hERG potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.

A novel lactamimide <span class=\"chem\">compound</span>, MDL 12,330A, has been shown previously to have negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> and chronotropic effects in isolated working <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> hearts and these effects are reversed by the administration of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span>. MDL 12,330A is potent in enhancing [3H]NTD <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> in membranes prepared from the cerebral cortex and the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>, with <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values of 6.1 X 10(-8) and 3.4 X 10(-8) M, respectively, at 37 degrees C. This allosteric effect by MDL 12,330A is similar to that produced by a known <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, d-cis <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>, which has been shown previously to enhance [3H]NTD <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> at 37 degrees C. The extent of enhancement by MDL 12,330A depends on incubation temperature (37 degrees C greater than 25 degrees C greater than 0 degrees C). The mechanism of this enhancement by MDL 12,330A is due to a decrease in the dissociation rate constant of the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span>-<span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> supramolecular complex. MDL 12,330A is the most potent drug thus far examined which demonstrates the enhancement of [3H]NTD <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>.</td>\n",

Here, we investigated the inhibition of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (I(Ca)) by antidepressants in enzymatically isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes using whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span>. The molecular mechanism of inhibition was studied by comparing the voltage and state dependence of antidepressant inhibition of I(Ca) to the respective properties of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span>, and by studying the effect of (+/-)-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-[trifluoromethyl]phenyl)-3-pyridine carboxylic acid methyl ester (Bay K8644) or <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> on the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of the antidepressants. All selected antidepressants inhibited <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents reversibly and concentration-dependently. At a stimulation frequency of 0.33 Hz, the antidepressants <span class=\"chemicals\">imipramine</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">clomipramine</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">desipramine</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">amitriptyline</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">maprotiline</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">citalopram</span>, and <span class=\"chemicals\">dibenzepin</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(Ca), with IC(50) values of 8.3, 11.6, 11.7, 23.2, 31.0, 64.5, and 364 muM. The antidepressant drugs shifted steady-state inactivation curves of I(Ca) to negative voltages. The extent of the shift was similar to that induced by <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> or <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, but it was significantly smaller than that induced by <span class=\"chemicals\">felodipine</span>. The <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> component of the antidepressant-induced <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was similar to that of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>, and it was significantly more and less, respectively, than those of <span class=\"chemicals\">felodipine</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>. In the presence of Bay K8644, antidepressants were more effective in inhibiting I(Ca). However, the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of antidepressants was also augmented by <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>, suggesting that these drugs do not compete with <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> for a single <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site. These data suggest that antidepressants exert their <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> action on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> by a specific interaction at a receptor site similar to, but distinct from, the <span class=\"chemicals\">benzothiazepine</span> site.</td>\n",

Racemic, S- and R-DPI depressed ICa in a concentration-dependent manner, the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values were 1.1 mumol l-1 for racemic and S-DPI, and 1.2 mumol l-1 for R-DPI, respectively. Racemic, S- and R-BDF 8784 also reduced ICa, the respective <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values were 3.6 mumol l-1 for racemic BDF 8784, 1.3 mumol l-1 for S-BDF 8784 and 1.1 mumol l-1 for R-BDF 8784. 3. Neither the DPI nor the BDF 8784 enantiomers alter the time course of inactivation of ICa. The steady-state inactivation curve for ICa was shifted along the voltage axis to negative membrane potentials. The <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of ICa was dependent on the membrane potential and increased with membrane depolarization. 4. Our findings indicate that DPI and BDF 8784 inhibit ICa in a non-stereoselective manner, which contrasts the opposite effects of the DPI enantiomers on <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.</td>\n",

The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect was more potent at the holding potential (HP) of - 50 mV than at - 80 mV. The half-maximum inhibiting concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of <span class=\"chemicals\">troglitazone</span> was 0.8 microM with the Hill coefficient of 0.84 at -50 mV HP. In contrast, the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value was higher than 10 microM at -80 mV HP. These results suggest that <span class=\"chemicals\">troglitazone</span> at therapeutic concentrations inhibit the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> and may exert <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> effects in diabetic conditions.</td>\n",

It is often used as an experimental tool for studying the role of the mitochondrial <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger in Ca(2+) signaling. Because the selectivity of CGP-37157 in adult <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> has not been confirmed, we tested whether CGP-37157 affects the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>using a whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> in adult <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. We found that CGP-37157 suppressed <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) with IC(50) of approximately 0.27 microM, without altering the voltage dependence of the current-voltage relationships. CGP-37157 inhibited the Ba(2+) current (I(Ba)) through the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>with a similar dose-response. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects of CGP-37157 on I(Ca) or I(Ba) were resistant to the intracellular Ca(2+) buffering. Intracellular application of CGP-37157 did not significantly alter I(Ca). The combination of CGP-37157 with known <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span><span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> yielded <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonism</span> consistent with additivity of response. Our data suggest that CGP-37157 directly suppresses the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>in intact adult <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>.</td>\n",

Radioligand <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> studies in vitro demonstrated a Ki of <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> for the lymphocyte beta 2-receptor of 32 +/- 4 microM. <span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> were much less potent. In studies of adenylate cyclase activity, <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> was shown to act as a competitive beta-receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>. Also, <span class=\"chemicals\">norverapamil</span>, the active metabolite of <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, had the highest <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> for the beta-receptor of any of the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span>-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> studied (Ki = 4.2 +/- 0.8 microM). After 1 week of <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> administration in six normal subjects, isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in lymphocytes was increased from 60 +/- 4% to 83 +/- 10% over basal activity (p less than .05). This was associated with an increase in lymphocyte beta-receptor <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> for agonist as represented by the decrease in the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for isoproterenol inhibition of [125I] iodocyanopindolol <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> from 240 +/- 20 to 170 +/- 10 nM (p less than .05). Additionally, plasma norepinephrine levels were reduced from 206 +/- 58 to 92 +/- 18 pg/ml with 1 week of <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> treatment (p less than .05). Our data suggest that <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> affects lymphocyte beta-receptors in vitro and with long-term administration regulates lymphocyte beta-receptor function either directly or indirectly via a reduction in plasma catecholamine levels.</td>\n",

The C-type inactivation-deficient mutations, Ser620Thr and Ser631Ala, reduced <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, which is consistent with a role for C-type inactivation in high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> drug <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, although the Ser620Thr mutation decreased <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> 20-fold more than the Ser631Ala mutation.

Thus, <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> shares high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> properties with other class III <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> drugs, and this may contribute to its <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> mechanism.</td>\n",

Ca2+ currents were separated into T-type and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> components by an appropriate voltage protocol. Extracellular application of 1 microM (+/-)-<span class=\"chemicals\">niguldipine</span> (NIG) resulted in a pronounced <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of both T-type (to 20 +/- 10% of control, n = 5) and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ currents (to 28 +/- 12% of control, n = 5). Current to voltage relationships clearly showed that both Ca2+ currents were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> over the whole voltage range examined (-60 to +40 mV). The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">niguldipine</span> on T-type Ca2+ currents was found to be <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span>, i.e. prolonged hyperpolarization to -90 mV led to a partial and transient removal of NIG <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for T-type Ca2+ current inhibition by (+/-)-NIG was determined as 0.18 microM. NIG action is stereospecific. (+)-<span class=\"chemicals\">niguldipine</span> was found to be more potent than (-)-<span class=\"chemicals\">niguldipine</span> in <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> both Ca2+ currents. This study demonstrates the Ca2+ <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> action of the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> NIG, which may not discriminate between T- and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>.</td>\n",

The effects of extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate ([ATP]zero) on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> currents in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> single sinoatrial nodal (SAN) cells, isolated by enzymatic dissociation, were investigated by use of whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques. 2. The application of [ATP]zero (2 microM-1 mM) produced an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> current peak amplitude (10 mM Ba2+ as charge carrier) in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 100 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1.83. 3. The presence of the adenosine receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span>, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, 0.1 microM) and 8-phenyltheophylline (10 microM) did not affect the [ATP]zero-induced inhibition of the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> currents. Adenosine (100 microM) had little effect on the basal <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> currents. Adenosine 500 microM, caused 23% inhibition of the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> current, which was abolished by 0.1 microM DPCPX. 4. The presence of the P2-purinoceptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span>, suramin (1, 10 and 100 microM), reactive blue 2 (1 and 10 microM) and pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS, 50 and 100 microM) failed to affect the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> action of [ATP]zero on <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> currents. 5. The relative rank order of <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of different nucleotides and nucleosides, at a concentration of 100 microM, on the inhibition of the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> currents is as follows: adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) = alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (alpha,beta MeATP) > > 2-methylthioATP (2-MeSATP) > or = adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) > > uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP) = adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) > adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) > or = adenosine. 6. These results suggest that [ATP]zero may play an important role in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> beat by inhibiting the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> currents in single SAN cells. This <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect is not due to the formation of adenosine resulting from the enzymatic degradation of [ATP]zero. Based on the relative order of <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of different nucleotides and nucleosides on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> currents and the ineffectiveness of the purinoceptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> tested, a novel type of purinoceptor may be involved.</td>\n",

METHODS: Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> technique was used to record ICa and INa in a single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes of <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span>. RESULTS: (1) DDPH (3 - 300 micromol . L-1) decreased ICa at 0 mV in a concentration-dependent manner with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of 28.5 micromol . L-1 (95 % confidence limits: 14.3 - 42.7 micromol . L-1, n = 8 cells from 8 guinea pigs). <span class=\"chemicals\">Verapamil</span> (0.3 - 30 micromol . L-1) reduced ICa with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of 1.8 micromol . L-1 (95 % confidence limits: 1.3 - 2.3 micromol . L-1, n = 6 cells from 6 guinea pigs). Mexiletine 100 micromol . L-1 did not affect ICa (n = 5 cells from 5 guinea pigs, P > 0.05). The degree of <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effect of DDPH 30 micromol/L on ICa was 58 % +/- 13 % (n = 5 cells from 5 guinea pigs, P < 0.01) at 1 Hz and 76 % +/- 11 % (n = 5 cells from 5 guinea pigs, P < 0.01) at 3 Hz. (2) DDPH (20 - 320 micromol . L-1) could also <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> INa in a concentration-dependent manner with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of 89.0 micromol . L-1 (95 % confidence limits: 68.7 - 109.3 micromol . L-1, n = 9 cells from 9 guinea pigs). The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of mexiletine was 32.2 micromol . L-1 (95 % confidence limits: 11.7 - 52.7 micromol . L-1, n = 5 cells from 5 guinea pigs). <span class=\"chemicals\">Verapamil</span> at the concentration of 10 micromol . L-1 did not affect INa (n = 5 cells from 5 guinea pigs, P > 0.05). The <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effect of DDPH 80 micromol/L on INa was non <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span>. CONCLUSION: DPH exhibited <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on both ICa and INa, but its <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on ICa was weaker than <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, and on INa was weaker than mexiletine.</td>\n",

McN-6186 showed some stimulation of 1,4-<span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span>-sensitive Ca++ uptake in neonatal <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells at concentrations of 1 and 3 nM. At higher concentrations McN-6186 inhibited this uptake in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells at concentrations approximately 100-fold less than those needed to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> the corresponding Ca++ uptake in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> anterior pituitary (GH3) cells. McN-6186 (2 microM) inhibited <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca++ channel</span> current in neonatal <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells in a <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> manner while having little or no effect on this current in GH3 cells. In some <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells tested, the T-type Ca++ current was also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by 2 microM McN-6186. McN-6186 inhibited (+)-[3H]PN200-110 <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> membranes with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of 1.45 X 10(-7) M and a shallow Hill slope (nH = 0.42). It is concluded that McN-6186 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca++ channels</span> in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> cells preferentially to those found in GH3 cells. Furthermore, McN-6186 may have other sites and mechanisms of action in addition to <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca++ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>.</td>\n",

Levosimendan significantly increased I(Ca,L) in a concentration-dependent manner (E(max), 139.0 +/- 1.8%; EC(50), 54 +/- 3.6 nM). The increase in I(Ca,L) induced by 1 microM levosimendan was significantly greater in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells (136.7 +/- 11.0%, n=8) than in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells (23.5 +/- 3.5%, n=6) (depolarization to +10 mV in each case). In <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells, I(Ca,L) was unaffected by 1-10 microM levosimendan. These results indicate that the selective phosphodiesterase-3 <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> levosimendan increases <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span>-cell I(Ca,L) significantly more strongly in <span class=\"species\">human</span> than in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> and <span class=\"species\">rat</span>. It seems likely that the positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect of levosimendan on the <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span> depends on an increase in I(Ca,L) that is modulated by adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent phosphorylation.</td>\n",

The underlying mechanism of Fe(II) on SR Ca2+ transport is shown to be a direct and potent action on the ryanodine receptor. Fe(II) inhibits the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of [3H]ryanodine when assayed in the presence of 5 microM Ca2+ with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 4 microM and in an apparently cooperative manner (nH = 1.7). In the presence of physiological (1 mM) Mg2+, Fe(II) decreases the sensitivity of ryanodine receptors toward activation by Ca2+ shifting <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> from 18 to 35 microM in the absence and presence of 5 microM Fe(II), respectively, without significant decrease in maximum [3H]ryanodine occupancy. In the presence of 5 microM Ca2+ and 1 mM Mg2+, Fe(II) decreases the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of doxorubicin (DXR) on [3H]ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> (shifts <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> from 8 to 24 microM in the absence and presence of 5 microM Fe(II)). These results suggest that Fe(II) competes with Ca2+ at the activator sites on the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> complex. The actions of Fe(II) on ryanodine receptor function is not correlated with membrane lipid peroxidation of SR vesicles since Fe(II) does not produce detectable changes in malondialdehyde using the thiobarbituric acid assay. These results demonstrate a direct inhibition of the Ca2+ release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> SR by Fe(II) which may be important in pathological states of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> during iron overload.</td>\n",

In these experiments, we have used the whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> technique to examine the effects of sertraline on the major <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> expressed in HEK293 cells and the native <span class=\"calcium\">voltage-gated Ca</span>(2+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. According to the results, sertraline is a potent <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, such as hERG, I(Ks) and I(K1). The rank order of <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> was hERG >I(K1)> I(Ks) with IC(50) values of 0.7, 10.5, and 15.2 µM, respectively. In addition to K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, sertraline also inhibited I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) and I(Ca), and the IC(50) values are 6.1 and 2.6 µM, respectively. Modification of these ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> by sertraline could induce changes of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> action potential duration and <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval, and might result in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmia</span>.</td>\n",

The effects of No. 7943 on the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange current and on other membrane currents were investigated in single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells of <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> with the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> technique. 2. No. 7943 at 0.1-10 microM suppressed the outward <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange current in a concentration-dependent manner. The suppression was reversible and the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value was approximately 0.32 microM. 3. No. 7943 at 5-50 microM suppressed also the inward <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange current in a concentration-dependent manner but with a higher <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of approximately 17 microM. 4. In a concentration-response curve, No. 7943 raised the K(m)Ca2+ value, but did not affect the Imax value, indicating that No. 7943 is a competitive <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> with external Ca2+ for the outward <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/ Ca2+ exchange current. 5. The voltage-gated <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ current, Ca2+ current and the inward rectifier K+ current were also inhibited by No. 7943 with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50S</span> of approximately 14, 8 and 7 microM, respectively. 6. In contrast to No. 7943, 3', 4'-dichlorobenzamil (DCB) at 3-30 microM suppressed the inward <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange current with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 17 microM, but did not affect the outward exchange current at these concentrations. 7. We conclude that No. 7943 inhibits the outward <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange current more potently than any other currents as a competitive <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> with external Ca2+. This effect is in contrast to DCB which preferentially inhibits the inward rather than the outward <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange current.</td>\n",

This study examined whether carvedilol altered [Ca2+]i and caused cell death in HA59T cells. [Ca2+]i and cell viability were measured using the fluorescent dyes fura-2 and WST-1, respectively. Carvedilol at concentrations >or=1 microM increased [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value of 20 microM. The Ca2+ signal was reduced partly by removing extracellular Ca2+. Carvedilol induced Mn2+ quench of fura-2 fluorescence, implicating Ca2+ influx. The Ca2+ influx was sensitive to La3+, econazole, <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>, and SKF96365. In Ca2+-free medium, after pretreatment with 1 muM thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>), carvedilol-induced [Ca2+]i rises were abolished; and conversely, carvedilol pretreatment inhibited a major part of thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i rises. Inhibition of phospholipase C with 2 microM U73122 did not change carvedilol-induced [Ca2+]i rises. At concentrations between 1 and 50 microM, carvedilol killed cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of 1 microM (but not 30 microM) carvedilol was fully reversed by prechelating cytosolic Ca2+ with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM). Apoptosis was induced by 30 (but not 1) microM carvedilol. Collectively, in HA59T hepatoma cells, carvedilol induced [Ca2+]i rises by causing Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum in a phospholipase-C-independent manner and Ca2+ influx via store-operated <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>. Carvedilol-caused cytotoxicity was mediated by Ca2+ and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner.</td>\n",

The extracellular application of DTZ417 suppressed the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> currents (I[Ca(L)]) with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of 1.2 +/- 0.02 microM, which was close to the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> (0.63 +/- 0.01 microM). The suppression of I[Ca(L)] by DTZ417 was voltage and <span class=\"effect\">use dependent</span> but lacked <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, which allowed us to investigate the onset of the effect on I[Ca(L)] by changing the holding potential (HP) from -90 to -50 mV in the presence of DTZ417. DTZ417 did not have significant effects on I[Ca(L)] at an HP of -90 mV. At -50 mV, DTZ417 (50 microM) applied from the extracellular side completely suppressed I[Ca(L)], whereas it had no effect from the intracellular side. <span class=\"chemicals\">DTZ323</span> (1 microM) also inhibited I[Ca(L)] only from the extracellular side, without any effects by the intracellular application of < or = 10 microM. However, a quaternary <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamine</span> derivative, D890 (0.1 mM), acted only from the intracellular side. These results suggest that in contrast to the <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamine</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site, in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes the 1,5-<span class=\"chemicals\">benzothiazepine</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site is accessible from the extracellular side of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span>.</td>\n",

Bath application of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span> decreased the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current [I(Ca(L))] in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal inhibition of I(Ca(L)) was about 40% (attained at concentrations above 100 microM); the concentration for half-inhibition (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) was 11 microM. The effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span> (applied for about 5 min) was poorly reversible after washout for up to 5 min. The potential for half-inhibition (Vh) of the steady-state inactivation curve was shifted in the negative direction by 7 mV (at 100 microM) by <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>, and the slope factor was also slightly changed; the activation curve was not affected. Daidzein, which is structurally related to <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>, but has little <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on tyrosine kinase activity (of the EGF receptor), unexpectedly had almost the same <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on I(Ca(L)). These observations suggest two possibilities for modulation of I(Ca(L)) in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells by <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>: (a) phosphorylation of the slow <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> by tyrosine kinase; and (b) direct inhibition of the slow <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> (i.e. independent of inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity).</td>\n",

Whole-cell current and membrane potential were recorded using <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques. In <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, AMP 579 inhibited I(Kr) in a concentration-dependent manner with IC(50) value of 15.2 microM, when I(Kr) was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by chromanol 293B. On the contrary, AMP 579 (10 microM) did not affect I(Ks) in the presence of the I(Kr) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span>. The former effect of AMP 579 was unaffected by either the selective adenosine A(1) receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine or the non-selective adenosine A(1)/A(2) receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> 8-sulphophenyltheophylline. Moreover, AMP 579-induced inhibition of I(Kr) was not voltage- and frequency-dependent. In HEK 293 cells expressing HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, AMP 579 (10 microM) significantly <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the HERG current at +10 mV by 34.9+/-7.0% (n=4, p<0.05), and the degree of inhibition was comparable with that observed in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes (36.8+/-6.0%, n=4). AMP 579 (10 microM) significantly inhibited the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) by 41.0+/-6.8% (n=5, p<0.05), which was unaffected by 8-sulphophenyl-theophylline. Consequently, despite its <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> actions on I(Kr) or HERG current, the drug significantly shortened the action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization from 275.6+/-19.4 to 208.3+/-18.6 ms (n=4, p<0.05). Thus, AMP 579 inhibits both native I(Kr) and cloned HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> with additional <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of I(Ca), and such <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects may at least partially underlie the observed antifibrillatory action of the drug during <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> ischemia/reperfusion.</td>\n",

Both <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the Ba++ inward current. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values at a holding potential of -80 or -40 mV were 4.9 and 1.4 microM for Ro 40-5967 and 250 and 15.5 microM for <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>. Both Ro 40-5967 and <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> induced a partial <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> at a holding potential of -80 mV. The <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> increased with high depolarization rates. Both Ro 40-5967 and <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> shifted the steady-state inactivation curve by more than 20 mV to hyperpolarized membrane potentials and decreased the inactivation rate constant. The effect of Ro 40-5967, but not that of <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, was attenuated by intracellular dialysis with GTP gamma S. The <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> for <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> was not affected by replacing Ba++ by Ca++, but was increased by the coexpression of the beta 3-subunit. These results indicate that both <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> interact with high <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> with the inactivated <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> state, but may interact additionally with the open <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>.</td>\n",

These drugs are characterized by high <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> efficacy, but they can also initiate life-threatening \"<span class=\"effect\">torsade de pointes</span>\" tachyarrhythmias. Recently, it has been suggested that combining potassium and <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> mechanisms reduces the proarrhythmic potential of selective class III <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> agents. BRL-32872 is a novel <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> drug that inhibits potassium and <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents in isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. In our study, we investigated the effects of BRL-32872 on cloned HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Using the two-microelectrode <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> technique, we found that BRL-32872 caused a high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span>, state-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of open HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> (IC(50) = 241 nM) in a frequency-dependent manner with slow unbinding kinetics. Inactivated <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> mainly had to open to be <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by BRL-32872. The HERG S620T mutant <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>, which has a strongly reduced degree of inactivation, was 51-fold less sensitive to BRL-32872 <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, indicating that BRL-32872 <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> was enhanced by the inactivation process. In an additional approach, we studied HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> expressed in a <span class=\"species\">human</span> cell line (HEK 293) using the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. BRL-32872 inhibited HERG currents in HEK 293 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of 19.8 nM. We conclude that BRL-32872 is a potent <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of HERG potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, which accounts for the class III <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> action of BRL-32872.</td>\n",

The purification factors for the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"chem\">ligands</span> (+)-3H-PN 200-110, 3H-<span class=\"chemicals\">nimodipine</span> (1,4-<span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridines</span>) and (-)-3-H-desmethoxyverapamil (a <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamine</span>) were 3.1-, 3.4- and 2.9-fold, respectively, whilst beta-adrenoceptors labelled with (-)-3H-dihydroalprenolol were purified 3.0-fold. (+)-3H-PN 200-110 bound to 930 +/- 140 fmol/mg of membrane protein with a dissociation constant of 70 pmol/l at 25 degrees C. Under the same conditions 3H-<span class=\"chemicals\">nimodipine</span> bound to 490 +/- 24 fmol/mg of sites with a KD of 120 pmol/l. (-)-3-H-desmethoxyverapamil bound to 530 +/- 55 fmol/mg of sites with a KD of 2.47 nmol/l. Twelve 1,4-<span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridines</span> were evaluated for <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> inhibition constants (Ki) with (+)-3H-PN 200-110 and 13 <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamines</span> with (-)-3-H-desmethoxyverapamil in radioligand <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> assays. Of the twelve 1,4-<span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridines</span> evaluated (+/-)-<span class=\"chemicals\">nitrendipine</span> was the most potent with a Ki-value of 280 pmol/l, <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> had a Ki-value of 500 pmol/l and the weakest drug tested, (+/-)-Bay b 4328, had a Ki-value of 14.3 nmol/l. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>-values of the same 1,4-<span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridines</span> to inhibit the electrically driven cat <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle were 77- to 3,450-fold higher and little correlation existed between Ki and <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>-values. Thirteen <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamines</span> were tested for their <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> to inhibit (-)-3-H-desmethoxyverapamil <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>. The most potent <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamine</span> with respect to negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span> was (+/-)-D 595 with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>-value of 794 nmol/l, the least potent substance was (+/-)-Sz 45 with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>-value of 39.8 mumol/l. The <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> inhibition constants for the <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamines</span> were 13- to 322-fold lower than the values for negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span>, but a significant positive correlation between the Ki and <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>-values (n = 12, r = 0.84) was observed. The absolute differences may reflect the state-dependent <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamines</span> to the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. QSAR analysis revealed nearly identical correlations between physicochemical substituent properties on the one hand and <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> <span class=\"chem\">affinities</span> or functional <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> on the other hand. In both cases the electronic properties (F-constant) of ring substituents mainly determine the variance in <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>.</td>\n",

SN-6 suppressed the bidirectional I(NCX) in a concentration-dependent manner. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of SN-6 were 2.3 microM and 1.9 microM for the outward and inward components of the bidirectional I(NCX), respectively. On the other hand, SN-6 suppressed the unidirectional outward I(NCX) more potently than the inward I(NCX), with an IC(50) value of 0.6 microM. SN-6 at 10 microM inhibited the unidirectional inward I(NCX) by only 22.4 +/- 3.1%. SN-6 suppressed I(NCX) more potentially when intracellular <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ concentration became higher. SN-6 inhibited I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>), I(Ca), I(Kr), I(Ks), and I(K1) by about 13%, 34%, 33%, 18%, and 13%, respectively. SN-6 shortened the action potential duration (APD) by about 34% and 25% at APD(50) and APD(90), respectively. These results indicate that SN-6 inhibits NCX in a similar manner to that of KB-R7943. SN-6 and KB-R7943 inhibit the unidirectional outward I(NCX) more potently than the unidirectional inward I(NCX). Both drugs inhibit NCX in an intracellular <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ concentration-dependent manner. However, SN-6 affected other membrane currents less potently than KB-R7943.</td>\n",

The muscarinic agonists acetylcholine (ACh) and oxotremorine-M partially inhibited the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> (mean <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> 37%) with <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values of 0.32 microM and 0.14 microM, respectively. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for ACh in the presence of neostigmine (1 microM) was 0.11 microM. Tetraethylammonium (TEA) (10 mM) (10 mM) shifted ACh (+ neostigmine) and oxotremorine dose response curves to the right by 36- and 20-fold, respectively. TEA also inhibited muscarinic receptor <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> (Ki values in brackets) of (i) N-methyl scopolamine ([3H]NMS) to homogenates of <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> (86 microM) and <span class=\"species\">rat</span> submandibular gland (178 microM) and to intact NG 108-15 cells (358 microM) and (ii) [3H]pirenzepine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to <span class=\"species\">rat</span> cerebral cortex homogenates (111 microM). Atropine antagonized muscarinic agonist responses and was found to have a pKB of 9.8 +/- 0.39, but 10 mM TEA reduced the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of atropine by 69-fold, probably because of the weak <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> action of TEA.</td>\n",

The modulation of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> current (ICa) by <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span>, a diphenylalkylamine type of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> was investigated on <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes by use of the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. 2. <span class=\"chemicals\">Fendiline</span>-induced <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of ICa is accompanied by modulation of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> kinetics in a complex manner. The time course of ICa inactivation is significantly faster and the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> availability (f infinity) curve is shifted considerably to more negative potentials by <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span>. These findings can be interpreted qualitatively in terms of a modulated receptor. 3. When the 1,4-<span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> agonist (4R, 4S)-Bay K 8644 was added in presence of 30 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span> a further reduction of ICa instead of the expected stimulatory effect was observed. 4. A similar 'paradoxical' inhibition of ICa was produced by the pure agonist enantiomer (4S)-Bay K 8644. Thus this novel effect of Bay K 8644 cannot be attributed to changes in <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> of the 1,4-<span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> receptor site for (4R)-Bay K 8644 during <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span> action. 5. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span> was reduced to 3.0 +/- 0.1 microM (control value: 17.0 +/- 2.4 microM) and the Hill slope in its presence was increased to 1.90 +/- 0.1 (control value: 1.39 +/- 0.23) by 1 microM (4R, 4S)-Bay K 8644. 6. (4R,4S)-Bay K 8644 caused the expected stimulation of ICa in the presence of <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>, overcoming the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of these <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span>. 7. The 'paradoxical' <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of the agonist Bay K 8644 can be explained in terms of an allosteric interaction between <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span> and the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> agonist.</td>\n",

The radioligand <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> studies are consistent with other reports that the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> and excitatory <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridines</span> share a single <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site. The <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> method was used for recording whole cell <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents. (-)-Bay k 8644 and (+)-202-791 produced <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> increases in the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents. The magnitude of the effect was dependent on the holding potential. At holding potentials between -40 and -90 mV these activators increased <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents in a concentration-dependent manner with <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values of 25 nM and 80 nM, respectively. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> (+)-Bay k 8644, (-)-202-791, (+)- and (-)-<span class=\"chemicals\">nimodipine</span>, and (+)-PN200-110 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents with <span class=\"chem\">potencies</span> that depended upon holding potential. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values for these enantiomers measured at a holding potential of -80 mV were, respectively, 8000, 200, 2000, 450, and 400 nM, and <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values measured at a holding potential of -30 mV were 26, 1.0, 52, 4.0, and 4.5 nM. The dissociation constants calculated for some <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridines</span> are similar to the Kd values determined by radioligand <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>. However, for other <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridines</span>, large discrepancies between the concentrations giving rise to half-maximal <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects and the Kd values from <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> studies could not be reconciled by <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> alone.

METHODS: I(Ca-L) was recorded by <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique in whole-cell configuration. RESULTS: Adenosine (10 nmol/L to 50 micromol/L) showed no effect on basal I(Ca-L), but it inhibited the I(Ca-L) induced by isoproterenol 10 nmol/L in a concentration-dependent manner with the IC(50) of 13.06 micromol/L. Similar to adenosine, AMP579 also showed an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on the I(Ca-L) induced by isoproterenol. AMP579 and adenosine (both in 10 micromol/L) suppressed isoproterenol-induced ICa-L by 11.1% and 5.2%, respectively. In addition, AMP579 had a direct <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on basal I(Ca-L) in a concentration-dependent manner with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> (1.17 micromol/L). PD116948 (30 micromol/L), an adenosine A1 receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>, showed no action on the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of AMP579 on basal I(Ca-L). However, GF109203X (0.4 micromol/L), a special protein kinase C (PKC) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>, could abolish the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of AMP579 on basal I(Ca-L). So the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of AMP579 on basal I(Ca-L) was induced through activating PKC, but not linked to adenosine A1 receptor. CONCLUSION: AMP579 shows a stronger <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect than adenosine on the I(Ca-L) induced by isoproterenol. AMP579 also has a strong <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on basal I(Ca-L) in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Activation of PKC is involved in the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of AMP579 on basal I(Ca-L) at downstream-mechanism.</td>\n",

At -80 mV, <span class=\"chemicals\">cilnidipine</span> had little <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect below concentrations of 1 microM on I(Ca,L) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value; 17 microM). However, 1 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">cilnidipine</span> strongly shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of I(Ca,L) toward negative potentials without changing the current-voltage relationship. Each action of <span class=\"chemicals\">cilnidipine</span> was characterized by a high <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> for the inactivated <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> in preference to the resting <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridines</span> for I(Ca,L) were in the range between 0.01 and 10 microM, and those for I(Ca,N) were between 3 and 30 microM. <span class=\"chemicals\">Cilnidipine</span> had the strongest <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> for I(Ca,N) among the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridines</span> tested. These results suggest that <span class=\"chemicals\">cilnidipine</span> did not cause hypotension-evoked <span class=\"effect\">tachycardia</span> deficiency by depression of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> but by sympathetic N-type <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>.</td>\n",

Both drugs depressed the spontaneous activity and often caused sinus arrest. The negative chronotropic effect was significant at 10 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span> and 30 microM disopyramide. The <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current decreased by 69.7+/-3.2% and by 45.8+/-3.0% at 30 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span> and by 51. 2+/-3.3% and by 48.3+/-2.7% at 100 microM disopyramide, respectively. The delayed rectifier K(+) current, which is composed of rapidly and slowly activated currents (I(Kr) and I(Ks)), also decreased. The IC(50) values of I(Kr) for <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span> and disopyramide were 8.8+/-1. 1 and 25.1+/-2.3 microM, respectively. In the presence of 5 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span> (1-[2-(6-methyl-2-pyridyl)ethyl]-4-(4-methylsulfonylaminobenzoyl) <span class=\"chemicals\">piperidine</span>), the IC(50) values of I(Ks) for <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span> and disopyramide were 12.3+/-1.8 and 81.1+/-2.3 microM, respectively. The I(Ks) was completely <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by 30 microM 293B (trans-6-cyano-4-(N-ethylsulphonyl-N-methtamino)-3-hydroxy-2 , 2-dimethyl-chromane). These results indicate that the ionic currents are more sensitive to <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span> than disopyramide in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> sino-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> nodal cells, and that I(Ca) and I(Kr) make major contributions to pacemaking activity.</td>\n",

It was found that <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> substantially inhibited I(to1) in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC(50) of 29.2+/-2.4 microM, and <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> showed a similar effect (IC(50)=26.8+/-2.1 muM). The two drugs had no effect on <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> kinetics of the current; however, they accelerated I(to1) inactivation significantly, suggesting an open <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>. 3. In addition, <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> suppressed I(Kur) in a concentration-dependent manner (at +50 mV, IC(50)=11.2+/-0.9 and 8.2+/-0.8 microM, respectively). These results indicate that the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span><span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> substantially inhibit I(to1) and I(Kur) in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes.</td>\n",

Electron density profiles (A vs electrons/A3) calculated from the diffraction data (37 degrees C) demonstrated that <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> had an equilibrium location in the hydrocarbon core/headgroup region of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> bilayer, 12-27 A from the center of the membrane. <span class=\"chemicals\">Mibefradil</span> also effected a pronounced reduction in electron density 0-11 A from the center of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> membrane concomitant with a 7.5% (3 A) decrease in membrane hydrocarbon core thickness; these changes in membrane structure were not observed with the <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamine</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, a CCA with some structural similarity to <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span>. As a result of membrane physico-<span class=\"chem\">chemical</span> interactions, <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> inhibited (10-500 nM) lipid peroxide formation in liposomes enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids. In aortic endothelial cells, <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> also inhibited loss of cell viability (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 2 microM) following acute oxy-radical generation by dihydroxyfumarate and Fe-ADP; the order of <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> was <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> > <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> > <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>. These findings indicate that the <span class=\"chem\">chemical</span> structure of <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> contributes to biophysical interactions with the cell membrane that underlie antioxidant and cytoprotective activities in models of oxidative stress.</td>\n",

METHODS: <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange current (INa+/Ca2+) and other currents were measured using whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> technique. RESULTS: A concentration-dependent inhibition of hexapeptide FRCRSFa on <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> +/Ca2+ exchange was observed in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of inward and outward INa+/Ca2+ were 2 and 4 micromol/L, respectively. FRCRSFa 5 micromol/L did not affect <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current, voltage-gated <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ current, transient outward K+ current, and inward rectifier K+ current. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that FRCRSFa is an available <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange with relative selectivity and m ay be valuable for studies of the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes.</td>\n",

To elucidate the mechanism underlying the <span class=\"effect\">anti-arrhythmic</span> effect of changrolin, we used the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique to characterize the <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> actions of changrolin in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. In this study, changrolin inhibited delayed rectified K(+) currents (I(K)) in a concentration-dependent manner with inhibiting the current by 11.9%±4.7%, 27.8%±3.4%, 31.5%±3.6% and 40.8%±3.7% at 10, 30, 100 and 300 μM, respectively (n=7-8). Changrolin was less effective against transient outward K(+) currents (I(to)), and only showed significantly <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect at the highest concentration (300 μM). Changrolin also induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> currents (I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>)) with an IC(50) of 10.19 μM (Hill coefficient=-1.727, n=6-7). In addition, changrolin exerted a holding potential-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> on <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, produced a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation curve, as well as exhibited a marked frequency-dependent component to the <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Finally, <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents (I(Ca)) was decreased by changrolin in a concentration-dependent manner with an estimated IC(50) of 74.73 μM (Hill coefficient=-0.9082, n=6). In conclusion, changrolin <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span>, and also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> (I(to) and I(K)) to some extent. Notably, changrolin preferentially <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> the inactivated state of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. These effects lead to a modification of electromechanical function and likely contribute to the termination of <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmia</span>.</td>\n",

Although <span class=\"chemicals\">tolterodine</span> has not been reported to alter <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> repolarization, it is chemically related to other muscarinic <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> known to prolong <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> repolarization. For this reason, we studied the effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">tolterodine</span> on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> and action potential recordings. Using <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiology</span>, we found that <span class=\"chemicals\">tolterodine</span> was a potent <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> of the <span class=\"species\">human</span> ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>, displaying an IC(50) value of 17 nM. This <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> was similar to that observed for the <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> drug <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span> (IC(50) of 11 nM). <span class=\"chemicals\">Tolterodine</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of HERG displayed a positive voltage dependence, suggesting an interaction with an activated state. <span class=\"chemicals\">Tolterodine</span> had little effect on the <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> at concentrations of up to 1 microM. Inhibition of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) currents by <span class=\"chemicals\">tolterodine</span> was frequency-dependent with IC(50) values measuring 143 and 1084 nM at 1 and 0.1 Hz, respectively. Both <span class=\"chemicals\">tolterodine</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span> prolonged action potential duration in single <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> myocytes over the concentration range of 3 to 100 nM. However, prolongation was significantly larger for <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span> compared with <span class=\"chemicals\">tolterodine</span>. <span class=\"chemicals\">Tolterodine</span> seems to be an unusual drug in that it <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> HERG with high <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span>, but produces little <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> prolongation clinically.

[3H]Atenolol efflux from preloaded PC12 cells was increased 4-fold in response to membrane depolarization by elevated extracellular potassium (50 mM). [3H]Norepinephrine release was enhanced 4.5-fold under the same conditions. Potassium-induced release of both [3H] atenolol and [3H]norepinephrine was inhibited completely in the absence of extracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span>. [3H]Atenolol release from PC12 cells was also reduced by the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 1.6 +/- 0.5 nM). In addition, the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> agonist BAY K8644 (1 microM) significantly enhanced potassium-induced [3H]atenolol efflux. After loading overnight, accumulation and storage of the (-)-enantiomer of atenolol by PC12 cells was found to be approximately 3-fold greater than that of the (+)-enantiomer. The (-)-enantiomer of atenolol was also preferentially released by 50 mM potassium with a (-)/(+)-enantiomer ratio of 3.6 to 1. The results support the existence within neurosecretory cells of storage and <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span>-dependent release mechanisms which result in stereoselective secretion of the (-)-or active enantiomer of atenolol in response to membrane depolarization.</td>\n",

The increase in <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> was due primarily to a 30% increase in the association rate constant (k+1) of [3H]<span class=\"chemicals\">nitrendipine</span>, causing a decrease in the KD from a control value of 0.40 to 0.28 nM.

The increase was due primarily to an increase in receptor site density (maximum <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>).

To determine its mechanism of action, we studied its biochemical and physiological effects on <span class=\"species\">human</span> red blood cell <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> transports on different cellular structures regarded as sites of contractile control, and we compared its relative efficacy to ouabain in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> preparations and membrane-bound <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>, K-ATPase isoenzymes. The response to ouabain was evaluated in Langendorff-perfused hearts and on purified membrane-bound <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>, K-ATPase. LND-623 is 6.8-fold more efficient than ouabain in inhibiting the <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ pump (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 0.098 +/- 0.001 microM vs. 0.67 +/- 0.02 microM); (P < 0.0001). LND-623 had no effect on the following cellular functions: <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>-Ca exchange, <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>-K cotransport, Ca-ATPase, slow <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, adenylate cyclase system, phosphodiesterase, and <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> sensitivity of the contractile protein system. The dose-response curve for the positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> and <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> isoenzymes produced by LND-623 were clearly biphasic. The amplitude of the maximum <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect, without any toxic effect, was up to three-fold higher with LND-623 than with the same maximum dose of ouabain used. The strong positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect of LND-623 in rats could be related to a specific inhibition of the two <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> isoforms of the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>, K-ATPase.</td>\n",

Many other Kv1.5 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> also potently inhibit the Kv1.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>, but whether DPO-1 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> Kv1.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> has not been investigated. The Kv1.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> is highly expressed in activated T cells, which is considered a favorable <span class=\"calcium\">target</span> for immunomodulation. Accordingly, we hypothesized that DPO-1 may exert immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting Kv1.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity. In this study, DPO-1 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> Kv1.3 current in a <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> and concentration-dependent manner, with IC₅₀ values of 2.58 µM in Jurkat cells and 3.11 µM in <span class=\"species\">human</span> peripheral blood T cells. DPO-1 also accelerated the inactivation rate and negatively shifted steady-state inactivation. Moreover, DPO-1 at 3 µM had no apparent effect on the Ca²⁺ activated potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> (K(Ca)) current in both Jurkat cells and <span class=\"species\">human</span> peripheral blood T cells. In Jurkat cells, pre-treatment with DPO-1 for 24 h decreased Kv1.3 current density, and protein expression by 48±6% and 60±9%, at 3 and 10 µM, respectively (both p<0.05). In addition, Ca²⁺ influx to Ca²⁺-depleted cells was blunted and IL-2 production was also reduced in activated Jurkat cells. IL-2 secretion was also inhibited by the Kv1.3 <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> margatoxin and charybdotoxin. Our results demonstrate for the first time that that DPO-1, at clinically relevant concentrations, <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> Kv1.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, decreases Kv1.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> expression and suppresses IL-2 secretion. Therefore, DPO-1 may be a useful treatment strategy for immunologic disorders.</td>\n",

Additionally, cyamemazine metabolites were compared with <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> for their effects on the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval in anaesthetized guinea pigs. Monodesmethyl cyamemazine and cyamemazine sulfoxide reduced hERG current amplitude, with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of 0.70 and 1.53 microM, respectively. By contrast, at a concentration of 1 microM, cyamemazine metabolites failed to significantly affect I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>), I(to), I(sus) or I(K1) current amplitudes. Cyamemazine sulfoxide had no effect on I(Ca) at 1 microM, while at this concentration, monodesmethyl cyamemazine only slightly (17%), albeit significantly, inhibited I(Ca) current. Finally, cyamemazine metabolites (5 mg kg(-1) i v.) were unable to significantly prolong QTc values in the <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span>. Conversely, <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> (5 mg kg(-1) i.v.) significantly increased QTc values. In conclusion, cyamemazine metabolite concentrations required to inhibit hERG current substantially exceed those necessary to achieve therapeutic activity of the parent <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> in humans. Moreover, cyamemazine metabolites, in contrast to <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span>, do not delay <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> repolarization in the anaesthetized <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span>. These non-clinical findings explain the excellent <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> safety records of cyamemazine during its 30 years of extensive therapeutic use.</td>\n",

Ang II at 30 nM-3 microM inhibited I(sus) with an IC(50) of 240 nM, a Hill coefficient of 1.0 and maximum inhibition of 19.4%. Ang II-mediated inhibition of I(sus) was voltage independent, was due to a decrease in the K(+) current and was abolished by the Ang II type-I (AT(1)) receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>, valsartan. The protein kinase C (PKC) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> PKC19-36 or calphostin C, abolished Ang II-mediated inhibition of I(sus). In contrast, pretreatment with the protein kinase A (PKA) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> PKA6-22 (100 microM) significantly enhanced the suppression of I(sus) by 1 microM Ang II: (33.7+/-5.1% vs. control 17.1+/-2.3%). These results indicate that Ang II inhibits I(sus) via the AT(1) receptor and activation of PKC. Ang II significantly prolonged action potential duration (APD) when the control APD was lengthened by a <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>activator, BAY K8644. In myocytes with a relatively long APD, Ang II may prolong APD by inhibiting I(sus).</td>\n",

At +30 mV, corresponding to a luminal to cytoplasmic cation current, the probability of opening (P(o)) of ryanodine-modified <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> was only marginally altered at pCa 10 (pCa = -log(10) Ca concentration). However, at -30 mV, the P(o) was highly sensitive to Ca(2+) added to the cis (cytoplasmic) side and, at pCa 10, was reduced to less than 0.27. The EC(50) value for <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> opening was about pCa 8. No significant Ca(2+) inactivation was observed for ryanodine-modified <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> at either -30 mV or +30 mV. The opening of unmodified <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> is Ca(2+) sensitive, with an EC(50) value of about pCa 6 (two orders of magnitude less sensitive than ryanodine-modified <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>) and IC(50) values of pCa 2.2 at -30 mV and 2.5 at +30 mV. Mg(2+) decreased the P(o) of ryanodine-modified <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> at low Ca(2+) concentrations at both -30 and +30 mV. Caffeine, ATP, and ruthenium red were <span class=\"other_terms\">modulators</span> of the P(o) of ryanodine-modified <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. In a [(3)H]ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> assay, [(3)H]ryanodine dissociation from the high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site was found to be Ca(2+) sensitive, with an IC(50) of pCa 7.1. High concentrations of unlabeled ryanodine prevented [(3)H]ryanodine dissociation, but ruthenium red accelerated dissociation. These results suggest that ryanodine sensitizes Ca(2+) activation of the Ca(2+) release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> and desensitizes Ca(2+) inactivation through an allosteric interaction. [(3)H]Ryanodine dissociates from the high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> site when the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> is closed by removal of Ca(2+), implying that high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> ryanodine and Ca(2+) <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> sites are linked through either short- or long-range interactions, probably involving conformational changes.</td>\n",

A23-induced current was independent of Cl(-) driving force, and strongly suppressed by addition of Cd(2+) and Ni(2+), and by removal of either external <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) or Ca(2+). These and other results suggested that A23 activated an NCX current driven by submembrane <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and Ca(2+) concentrations higher than those in the bulk cytoplasm. Improved control of intracellular <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and Ca(2+) concentrations was obtained by suppressing cation influx (10 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>) and raising dialysate <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) to 7 mM and dialysate pCa to 7. Under these conditions, stimulation by A23 was described by the Hill equation with EC(50) 68 +/- 4 microM and coefficient 1.1, tyrphostin A25 was as effective as A23, and TK-inactive tyrphostin A1 was ineffective. Phosphotyrosyl phosphatase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> orthovanadate (1 mM) antagonized the action of 100 microM A23. The results suggest that activation of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> NCX by A23 is due to inhibition of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>-insensitive TK.</td>\n",

Its primary <span class=\"calcium\">target</span> is the T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel</span> (IC(50), approximately 0.1-0.2 microM), but it also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+),K(+),Cl(-), and other <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> at higher concentrations. We have recently reported state-dependent <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in which apparent <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> was enhanced when <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were recruited to slow-inactivated conformations. The structural determinants controlling <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> have not been identified, although evidence suggests involvement of regions near or within the inner pore. We tested whether <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> interacts with the local anesthetic (LA) <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site, which includes residues in the S6 segments of domains (D) I, III, and IV. Mutagenesis of DIII S6 and DIVS6 did not reveal critical <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> determinants. Substitution of Asn406 in DI S6 of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(v)1.5, however, altered <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> in a manner dependent on the identity of the substituting residue. Replacing Asn406 with a phenylalanine or a cysteine increased <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> by 4- and 7-fold, respectively, thus conferring T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel-</span>like <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> sensitivity to the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. A series of other substitutions that varied in size, charge, and hydrophobicity had minimal effects on <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, but all mutations dramatically altered the magnitude and voltage-dependence of slow inactivation, consistent with data in other isoforms. <span class=\"calcium\">Channels</span> did not slow-inactivate, however, at the voltages used to assay <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, supporting the idea that Asn406 lies within or near the <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site.</td>\n",

We investigated whether or not <span class=\"chemicals\">lidoflazine</span> inhibits current through the rapid delayed rectifier K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> alpha subunit (encoded by HERG - <span class=\"species\">human</span> ether-a-go-go-related gene), since this <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> has been widely linked to drug-induced <span class=\"effect\">QT</span>-prolongation. <span class=\"chemicals\">Lidoflazine</span> inhibited potently HERG current (I(HERG)) recorded from HEK 293 cells stably expressing wild-type HERG (IC(50) of approximately 16 nM). It was approximately 13-fold more potent against HERG than was <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> under similar conditions. On membrane depolarization, I(HERG) inhibition developed gradually, ruling out closed-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> state dependent inhibition. The effect of command voltage on the drug's action suggested that <span class=\"chemicals\">lidoflazine</span> preferentially inhibits activated/open HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. The S6 mutation Y652A largely eliminated the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> action of <span class=\"chemicals\">lidoflazine</span>, whilst the F656A mutation also reduced <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>. We conclude: first, that <span class=\"chemicals\">lidoflazine</span> produces high <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of the alpha subunit of the HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> by <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to aromatic amino acid residues within the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> pore and, second, that this is likely to represent the molecular mechanism of <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval prolongation by this drug.</td>\n",

In isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">citalopram</span> inhibited <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (I(Ca,L)). The voltage dependence of I(Ca,L) inactivation in the presence of 100 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">citalopram</span> was shifted significantly leftward. As a result, the I(Ca,L) 'window' in <span class=\"chemicals\">citalopram</span> was found to be (a) smaller and (b) leftward-shifted compared to control. The effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">citalopram</span> on both <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current amplitude and the I(Ca,L) 'window' may help to explain <span class=\"chemicals\">citalopram</span>'s good <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> safety profile, given its propensity to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> HERG at excessive dosages.</td>\n",

Inhibition of I(to) was studied using cloned <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> (Kv) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, <span class=\"species\">rat</span> Kv4.3L, Kv4.2, and Kv1.4, expressed in <span class=\"species\">human</span> embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK293) cells. (2) Application of the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span><span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">nicardipine</span>, accelerated the inactivation rate and reduced the peak amplitude of Kv4.3L currents in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50): 0.42 micro M). The <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> (DHP) <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>agonist, Bay K 8644, also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> this K(+) current (IC(50): 1.74 micro M). (3) <span class=\"chemicals\">Nicardipine</span> (1 micro M) slightly, but significantly, shifted the voltage dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation to more negative potentials, and also slowed markedly the recovery from inactivation of Kv4.3L currents. (4) Coexpression of K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>-interacting protein 2 (KChIP2) significantly slowed the inactivation of Kv4.3L currents as expected. However, the features of DHP-induced <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of K(+) current were not substantially altered. (5) <span class=\"chemicals\">Nicardipine</span> exhibited similar <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of Kv1.4 and Kv4.2 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> stably expressed in HEK293 cells; IC(50)'s were 0.80 and 0.62 micro M, respectively. (6) Thus, at submicromolar concentrations, DHP Ca(2+) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> and agonist inhibit Kv4.3L and have similar inhibiting effects on other components of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> I(to), Kv4.2 and Kv1.4.</td>\n",

We determined whether this 11-fold difference in <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of adenosine is due to the existence of a greater A1 adenosine receptor reserve for the inhibition of beta-<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> than for the activation of IKAdo. <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">Atrial</span> myocytes were pretreated with vehicle (control) or the irreversible A1 adenosine receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> 8-cyclopentyl-3-[3-[[4-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl]oxy]propyl]-1-propylxa nthine (FSCPX) (10 and 50 nM) for 30 min, and after a 60-min washout period, concentration-response curves were determined for the adenosine-induced activation of IKAdo and inhibition of beta-<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>. Pretreatment of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes with 10 nM FSCPX reduced the maximal activation of IKAdo by 60% (7.9 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.1 pA/pF). In contrast, a higher concentration of FSCPX (50 nM) was required to reduce the maximal inhibition of beta-<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> by 39% (95 +/- 4% to 58. 7 +/- 5.6%) and caused a 15-fold increase in the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value of adenosine. Values of the equilibrium dissociation constant (KA) for adenosine to activate IKAdo and inhibit beta-<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>, estimated according to the method of Furchgott, were 2.7 and 5.6 microM, respectively. These values were used to determine the relationship between adenosine receptor occupancy and response. Half-maximal and maximal activations of IKAdo required occupancies of 40% and 98% of A1 adenosine receptors, respectively. In contrast, occupancies of only 4% and 70%, respectively, of A1 adenosine receptors were sufficient to cause half-maximal and maximal inhibitions of beta-<span class=\"calcium\">ICa, L</span>. Consistent with this result, a partial agonist of the A1 adenosine receptor SHA040 inhibited beta-<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> by 60 +/- 3.5% but activated IKAdo by only 18.1 +/- 2.5%. The results indicate that the A1 adenosine receptor is coupled more efficiently to an inhibition of beta-<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> than to an activation of IKAdo.</td>\n",

To determine the contribution of the various phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozymes to the regulation of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (ICa(L)) in the <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span>, we investigated the effect of selective and non-selective PDE <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> on ICa(L) in single <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells by use of the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> method. We repeated some experiments in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes, to make a species comparison. 2. In <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells, 100 microM pimobendan increased ICa(L) (evoked by depolarization to +10 mV from a holding potential of -40 mV) by 250.4 +/- 45.0% (n = 15), with the concentration for half-maximal stimulation (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>) being 1.13 microM. ICa(L) was increased by 100 microM UD-CG 212 by 174.5 +/- 30.2% (n = 10) with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value of 1.78 microM in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells. These two agents inhibit PDE III selectively. 3. A selective PDE IV <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, rolipram (1-100 microM), did not itself affect ICa(L) in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells. However, 100 microM rolipram significantly enhanced the effect of 100 microM UD-CG 212 on ICa(L) (increase with UD-CG 212 alone, 167.9 +/- 33.9, n = 5; increase with the two agents together, 270.0 +/- 52.2%; n = 5, P < 0.05). Rolipram also enhanced isoprenaline (5 nM)-stimulated ICa(L) by 52.9 +/- 9.3% (n = 5) in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells. 4. In <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells, ICa(L) at +10 mV was increased by 22.1 +/- 9.0% by UD-CG 212 (n = 10) and by 67.4 +/- 12.0% (n = 10) by pimobendan (each at 100 microM). These values were significantly lower than those obtained in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells (P < 0.0001). Rolipram (1-100 microM) did not itself affect ICa(L) in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells. However, ICa(L) was increased by 215.7 +/- 65.2% (n = 10) by the combination of 100 microM UD-CG 212 and 100 microM rolipram. This value was almost 10 times larger than that obtained for the effect of 100 microM UD-CG 212 alone. 5. These results imply a species difference: in the <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>, the PDE III isoform seems dominant, whereas PDE IV may be more important in the <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span> for regulating ICa(L). However, PDE IV might contribute significantly to the regulation of intracellular cyclic AMP in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span> when PDE III is already inhibited or when the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span> is under beta-adrenoceptor-mediated stimulation.</td>\n",

The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span> was 17.0 +/- 2.43 microM and the Hill slope was 1.39 +/- 0.23. 3. Inhibition of ICa by <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span> appeared with an onset of less than 3 s. 4. <span class=\"chemicals\">Fendiline</span> inhibited ICa at all the membrane potentials tested and shifted the current-voltage curve upwards. The overall <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> conductance (gCa) of the cell was reduced and conductance-voltage curve was shifted to the left in the presence of <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span>. 5. Isoprenaline (0.5-1 microM), a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, partially reversed the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span> on ICa. 6. It is suggested that <span class=\"chemicals\">fendiline</span> applied extracellularly <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> and reduces <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> conductance of the cell. The <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> thus inhibited are, nevertheless, still available for beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.</td>\n",

Combination of ouabain (1 mM) and monensin (20 microM) caused a marked increase in 45Ca2+ uptake in astrocytes. 45Ca2+ uptake was also stimulated by lowering the external <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ concentration. Ouabain plus monensin-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by 3,4-dichlorobenzamil (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>, 16 microM), an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, but not by <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> (0.1 microM). The stimulated-45Ca2+ uptake was observed even in K(+)-free medium, and external K+ at 5-10 mM caused a 2.2-fold increase in the uptake. Microspectrofluorimetry using the Ca(2+)-sensitive dye fura-2 showed that ouabain plus monensin increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration in single astrocytes. The Ca2+ signal was dependent on external Ca2+ (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>, 1.4 mM), and <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by 20 microM 3,4-dichlorobenzamil, but not by <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> (Cd2+, 20 microM; Ni2+, 100 microM). Antiserum of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-Ca2+ exchanger recognized 160 and 120-135 kDa proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of astrocyte homogenate. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of mRNA for the exchanger protein in astrocytes. These findings indicate that <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-Ca2+ exchanger which is modulated by K+ is present in cultured <span class=\"species\">rat</span> astrocytes.</td>\n",

Membrane potential and ionic currents were measured by the tight-seal, whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. Adenosine (10 microM) antagonized isoproterenol (20 nM)-stimulated <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> inward current (ICa). In the presence of isoproterenol, adenosine (10 microM) also increased holding and late outward currents. Isoproterenol (20 nM) caused a significant prolongation in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> action potential at the level of 0 mV, rather than at 90% repolarization. Adenosine shortened <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> action potential dose-dependently in the presence of isoproterenol. The respective values for <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> and maximally shortened action potential duration at 0 mV of adenosine with or without isoproterenol (20 nM) were 3.0 vs. 2.2 microM and 42.9 vs. 30.4 ms. In summary, during beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol, in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes, adenosine elicited the specific K(+)-outward current and concomitantly attenuated the isoproterenol-stimulated ICa. These phenomena may account for the modulation of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> action potential by adenosine with or without isoproterenol effect.</td>\n",

METHODS: Tight-seal whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques were performed to investigate the effects of palmatine on the delayed outward potassium currents (I(K)), inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)) and Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) current (I(CRAC)) in enzymatically isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hepatocytes. RESULTS: Palmatine 0.3-100 microM reduced I(K) in a concentration-dependent manner with EC(50) of 41.62+/-10.11 microM and n(H), 0.48+/-0.07 (n=8). The effect of the drug was poorly reversible after washout. When the bath solution was changed to tetraethylammonium (TEA) 8 mM, IK was inhibited. Palmatine 10 microM and 100 microM shifted the I-V curves of I(K) downward, and the <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(K) was voltage-independent. Palmatine 0.3-100 microM also inhibited I(CRAC) in a concentration-dependent manner. The fitting parameters were as follows: EC(50)=51.19+/-15.18 microM, and n(H)=0.46+/-0.07 (n=8). The peak value of I(CRAC) in the I-V relationship was decreased by palmatine 10 microM and 100 microM. But the reverse potential of I(CRAC) occurred at Voltage=0 mV in all cells. Palmatine 0.3-100 microM failed to have any significant effect on either inward or outward components of I(K1) at any membrane potential examined. CONCLUSION: The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on I(K) and I(CRAC) could be one of the mechanisms that palmatine exerts protective effect on hepatocytes.</td>\n",

SN-6 suppressed I(NCX) in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC(50) values of SN-6 were 2.3 microM and 1.9 microM for the outward and inward components of the bi-directional I(NCX), respectively. On the other hand, SN-6 suppressed the outward uni-directional I(NCX) more potently (IC(50) value of 0.6 microM) than the inward uni-directional I(NCX). SN-6 at 10 microM inhibited the uni-directional inward I(NCX) by only 22.4+/-3.1%. SN-6 and KB-R7943 suppressed I(NCX) more potently when intracellular <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) concentration was higher. Thus, both drugs inhibit NCX in an intracellular <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) concentration-dependent manner. Intracellular application of trypsin via a pipette solution did not change the <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effect of SN-6 on I(NCX). Therefore, SN-6 is categorized as an intracellular-trypsin-insensitive NCX <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>. SN-6 at 10 microM inhibited I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>), I(Ca), I(K) and I(K1) by about 13%, 34%, 33% and 13%, respectively. SN-6 at 10 microM shortened the action potential duration at 50% repolarization (APD(50)) by about 34%, and that at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) by about 25%. These results indicate that SN-6 inhibits NCX in a similar manner to that of KB-R7943. However, SN-6 at 10 microM affected other membrane currents less potently than KB-R7943.</td>\n",

The potential value of these <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> depends critically on their relative selectivity for I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca) over I(Ca). In the present work, therefore, the concentration-dependent effects of SEA0400 and KB-R7943 on I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca) and I(Ca) were studied and compared in canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> using the whole-cell configuration of the <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> technique. SEA0400 and KB-R7943 decreased I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca) in a concentration-dependent manner, having <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values of 111+/-43 nM and 3.35+/-0.82 microM, when suppressing inward currents, while the respective <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values were estimated at 108+/-18 nM and 4.74+/-0.69 microM in the case of outward current <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>. SEA0400 and KB-R7943 also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(Ca), having comparable <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values (3.6 microM and 3.2 microM, respectively). At higher concentrations (10 microM) both drugs accelerated inactivation of I(Ca), retarded recovery from inactivation and shifted the voltage dependence of inactivation towards more negative voltages. The voltage dependence of activation was slightly modified by SEA0400, but not by KB-R7943. Based on the relatively good selectivity of submicromolar concentrations of SEA0400--but not KB-R7943--for I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca) over I(Ca), SEA0400 appears to be a suitable tool to study the role of I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca) in Ca2+ handling in canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cells. At concentrations higher than 1 microM, however, I(Ca) is progressively suppressed by the <span class=\"chem\">compound</span>.</td>\n",

METHODS: Tight-seal whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques were performed to investigate the effects of berberine on the delayed outward potassium currents (I(K)), inward rectifier potassium currents (I(K1)) and Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) currents (I(CRAC)) in enzymatically isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hepatocytes. RESULTS: Berberine 1-300 micromol/L reduced I(K) in a concentration-dependent manner with EC(50) of 38.86+/-5.37 micromol/L and n(H) of 0.82+/-0.05 (n = 8). When the bath solution was changed to tetraethylammonium (TEA) 8 mmol/L, I(K) was inhibited. Berberine 30 micromol/L reduced I(K) at all examined membrane potentials, especially at potentials positive to +60 mV (n = 8, P<0.05 or P<0.01 vs control). Berberine had mild <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on I(K1) in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hepatocytes. Berberine 1-300 micromol/L also inhibited I(CRAC) in a concentration-dependent fashion. The fitting parameters were EC(50) = 47.20+/-10.86 micromol/L, n(H) = 0.71+/-0.09 (n = 8). The peak value of I(CRAC) in the I-V relationship was decreased by berberine 30 micromol/L at potential negative to -80 mV (n = 8, P<0.05 vs control). But the reverse potential of I(CRAC) occurred at voltage 0 mV in all cells. CONCLUSION: Berberine has <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on potassium and <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hepatocytes, which may be involved in hepatoprotection.</td>\n",

The mechanism of <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> by <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> was evaluated with two microelectrode <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span>. 2. Resting-state dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> (or initial <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>) of barium currents (IBa) through class A <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> was concentration dependent with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of 208+/-23 microM. 3. <span class=\"chemicals\">Mibefradil</span> (50 microM) did not significantly affect the midpoint voltage of the steady-state inactivation curve suggesting that inactivation does not promote <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>. Chimaeric class A/<span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> inactivating with faster or slower kinetics than wild type class A <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were equally well inhibited by <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> as wild type class A <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. 4. Frequent <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> activation facilitated IBa inhibition by <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> (<span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>). Recovery from <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span>, being slower at depolarized membrane potentials (tau = 75+/-15 s at -70 mV, (n=6) vs tau = 20+/-2 s at -100 mV, (n=6), P<0.05). 5. We suggest that <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of class A <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> by <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> occurs because of slow recovery from open <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> (SROB) and not because of drug <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to inactivated <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. 6. <span class=\"effect\">Voltage-dependent</span> slow recovery from open state-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> provides a molecular basis for understanding the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> profile of <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> such as selectivity for vasculature and relative lack of negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effects.</td>\n",

However, its utility as an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vivo or in situ in intact cells is limited because of its <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> and other cellular processes. We have synthesized a ruthenium derivative and found it to be an oxygen-bridged dinuclear ruthenium amine complex. It has the same <span class=\"chem\">chemical</span> structure as Ru360 reported previously (Emerson, J., Clarke, M. J., Ying, W-L., and Sanadi, D. R. (1993) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115, 11799-11805). Ru360 has been shown to be a potent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of Ca2+-stimulated respiration of liver mitochondria in vitro. However, the specificity of Ru360 on Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vitro or in intact cells has not been determined. The present study reports in detail the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>, the effectiveness, and the mechanism of inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by Ru360 and its specificity in vitro in isolated mitochondria and in situ in isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes. Ru360 was more potent (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 0.184 nM) than ruthenium red (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 6.85 nM) in inhibiting Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. 103Ru360 was found to bind to isolated mitochondria with high <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> (Kd = 0.34 nM, Bmax = 80 fmol/mg of mitochondrial protein). The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 103Ru360 for the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria was also 0.2 nM, indicating that saturation of a specific <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site is responsible for the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. Ru360, as high as 10 microM, produced no effect on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake or release, sarcolemmal <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange, actomyosin ATPase activity, <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> current, cytosolic Ca2+ transients, or cell shortening. 103Ru360 was taken up by isolated myocytes in a time-dependent biphasic manner. Ru360 (10 microM) applied outside intact <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamped</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes prevented Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ where the cells were progressively loaded with Ca2+ via sarcolemmal <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange by depolarization to +110 mV. We conclude that Ru360 specifically <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria and can be used in intact cells.</td>\n",

We used BDM further to shed light on the controversy surrounding direct phosphorylation of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span>. We employed a recombinant system that utilizes HEK 293 cells expressing wild type and mutant <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. BDM reversibly reduced the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> current induced by expression of the wild type <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> in a concentration-dependent manner with an apparent <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of 15.3 mM. Deletion of part of the carboxyl terminus of the alpha 1 subunit, which contains one putative protein kinase A site, or mutating all of the protein kinase A consensus sites of the pore forming subunit, did not significantly change the apparent <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value or alter in any other way the <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effect of BDM on the expressed currents. Our data suggest that BDM produces reversible modifications of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> protein leading to an expected reduction in the amplitude of the expressed currents, but the site of action must be different from that of the consensus sites for protein kinase A dependent phosphorylation.</td>\n",

Although lapatinib is associated with a risk of <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> prolongation, the effects of the drug on cellular <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> electrical properties and on action potential duration (APD) have not been studied. To evaluate the potential effects of lapatinib on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> repolarization, we investigated its <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects using a whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique in transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing <span class=\"species\">human</span> ether-à-go-go (hERG; to examine the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+) current, I(Kr)), KCNQ1/KCNE1 (to examine the slowly activating delayed rectifier K(+) current, I(Ks)), KCNJ2 (to examine the inwardly rectifying K(+) current, I(K1)), or SCN5A (to examine the inward <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) current, I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>)) and in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes (to examine the inward Ca(2+) current, I(Ca)). We also examined its effects on the APD at 90% (APD(90)) in isolated <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> Purkinje fibres. In ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> studies, lapatinib inhibited the hERG current in a concentration-dependent manner, with a half-maximum inhibition concentration (IC(50)) of 0.8 +/- 0.09 microm. In contrast, at concentrations up to 3 microm, lapatinib did not significantly reduce the I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>), I(K1) or I(Ca) amplitudes; at 3 microm, it did slightly inhibit the I(Ks) amplitude (by 19.4 +/- 4.7%; p < 0.05). At 5 microm, lapatinib induced prolongation of APD(90) by 16.1% (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the APD(90)-prolonging effect of lapatinib on <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> Purkinje fibres is primarily a result of inhibition of the hERG current and I(Ks), but not I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>), I(K1) or I(Ca).</td>\n",

Moreover, cyamemazine and <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> were compared for their effects on the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval in anesthetized guinea pigs. Cyamemazine reduced hERG current amplitude with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of 470 nM. Cyamemazine 1 microM failed to significantly affect INa, Ito, Isus, or IK1 amplitudes and slightly decreased ICa (18%). For comparison, haloperidol (30 nM) and olanzapine (300 nM) reduced hERG current amplitude by 44.2+/-3.9% and 49.7+/-4.2%, respectively. The <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> safety ratio of cyamemazine, calculated from the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>/receptor <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> ratios, is 81 and 313 against dopamine D2 receptors and 5-HT2A receptors, respectively. In guinea pigs, <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> and QTcBazett were not significantly modified by intravenous cyamemazine when compared to the effects produced by the vehicle. Conversely, <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> (5 mg/kg iv) increased significantly QTcBazett (+58 ms), QTcFrediricia (+83 ms) and QTcVan de Water (+78 ms). In conclusion, cyamemazine concentrations required to inhibit hERG current exceed substantially those necessary to achieve therapeutic activity in humans. Moreover, cyamemazine, in contrast to <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span>, does not delay <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> repolarization in the anesthetized <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span>. These non-clinical findings confirm the excellent <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> safety records of cyamemazine during its 30 years of extensive therapeutic use.</td>\n",

Steady state activation and inactivation parameters are shifted to more negative values in the presence of the <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span>. Similarly, KvLQT1/IsK is inhibited by <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 10.0 microM) and <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 11.8 microM), while being insensitive to <span class=\"chemicals\">nitrendipine</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>, or <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>. These results demonstrate that both cloned K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> HERG and KvLQT1/IsK, which represent together the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> delayed rectifier K+ current, are sensitive <span class=\"calcium\">targets</span> to <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span>. This work may help in understanding the mechanisms of action of <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> in certain <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"effect\">tachycardia</span>, as well as some of the deleterious adverse <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> events associated with <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span>.</td>\n",

Its potential ability to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> transient outward K(+) current (I(to)) has not been clearly documented. We performed whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> studies in canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. Extracellular application of Ba(2+) produced potent inhibition of I(to) with an IC(50) of approximately 40 microM. The effects were voltage independent, and the inactivation kinetics were not altered by Ba(2+). The <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of Ba(2+) was approximately 10 times higher than that of 4-aminopyridine (a selective I(to) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> with an IC(50) of 430 microM) under identical conditions. By comparison, Ba(2+) <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of the inward rectifier K(+) current was <span class=\"effect\">voltage dependent</span>; the IC(50) was approximately 20 times lower (2.5 microM) than that for I(to) when determined at -100 mV and was comparable to I(to) as determined at -60 mV (IC(50) = 26 microM). Ba(2+) concentrations of </=1 mM or higher failed to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> ultrarapid delayed rectifier K(+) current. Our data suggest that Ba(2+) can be considered a potent <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of I(to).</td>\n",

It remains unknown whether these two agents regulate the activity of ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> via a direct stimulation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that DPN or PPT stimulates the large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in cultured <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> fibroblasts (HCFs). In whole-cell configuration, depolarizing pulses evoked K(+) outward currents in an outward rectification in HCFs, the amplitude of which was increased in the presence of DPN or PPT. In inside-out patches, the activity of BK(Ca)-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> with a conductance of 167+/-8 pS was observed in these cells. PPT or DPN applied to the intracellular face of the membrane enhanced the activity of BK(Ca) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> with no change in single-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> conductance. DPN and PPT increased BK(Ca)-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity with an EC(50) value of 2.3 and 2.6 microM, respectively. The mean closed time of these <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> during the exposure to these <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> was reduced with no change in the gating charge of the <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Intracellular Ca(2+) was not altered by these two <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span>. RT-PCR analysis revealed that no change in the transcriptional level of the BK(Ca)-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> alpha-subunit was observed in chronic treatment with these two <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span>. PPT- and DPN-stimulated increase in BK(Ca) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> reveal novel pharmacological properties attributable to the activity of these <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, and their increase in BK(Ca) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> activity in HCFs may contribute to cell function.</td>\n",

The <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>-sensitive <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> is fully inhibited by BDM (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC(50)</span>5.8 +/- 0.4 mM) and nor PAM but is little affected by PAM. This inhibition is unaltered by the presence of BAY K 8644 but is antagonized by isoprenaline. The effect of isoprenaline is more pronounced when the solution in the patch pipette contains the non-hydrolysable <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span> of adenosine 5'-triphosphate, ATP gamma S (the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> is increased to 44.0 +/- 5.2 mM). A hastening of the inactivation of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> persists when either 10 mM 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) or 3 mM ATP gamma S is present in the pipette solution or when BAY K 8644 or isoprenaline are present in the bathing fluid. These results suggest that the inhibition of the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> is due to the phosphatase-like activity of the oximes but differs in some respects from previous work where a reduced level of phosphorylation is achieved by the introduction of protein kinase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> or protein phosphatases into the sarcoplasm in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> myocytes. These differences could be explained if <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channel</span> availability is regulated by at least two sites of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation with oximes able to rapidly dephosphorylate both sites, while one of these sites is not readily dephosphorylated by the endogenous phosphatases.</td>\n",

Carvacrol, thymol and eugenol suppressed peak Ca(2+) current at +5 mV, having EC(50) values and Hill coefficients of 98+/-11, 158+/-7 and 187+/-15 microM and 1.42+/-0.05, 2.96+/-0.43 and 1.6+/-0.1, respectively, in canine myocytes. Zingerone displayed a weak effect (estimated EC(50): 2+/-0.37 mM, Hill coefficient: 0.73+/-0.07), while vanillin and guaiacol failed to substantially modify Ca(2+) current up to the concentration of 1 mM. In addition to <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, thymol and carvacrol, but not eugenol, evoked marked rate-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> at 2 Hz. Carvacrol and eugenol accelerated inactivation of Ca(2+) current and caused leftward shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation without altering activation kinetics. Carvacrol, but not eugenol, increased the time constant of recovery from inactivation. These effects of carvacrol and eugenol developed rapidly and were largely reversible. In myocytes isolated from undiseased <span class=\"species\">human</span> hearts, the effect of carvacrol was similar to that observed in canine cells. It is concluded that suppression of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> Ca(2+) currents by phenol derivatives is influenced by the substituent in the benzene ring, and the <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effect of these drugs may involve interactions with the inactivation machinery of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>.</td>\n",

METHODS: The <span class=\"effect\">anti-arrhythmic</span> effects of <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> were studied against aconitine-induced <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> in rats and ouabain-induced <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> in guinea pigs. The effects of Sul on transmembrane action potentials were investigated in isolated <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> sinoatrial nodes and <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles using intracellular recording. With a whole-cell recording technique, the effects of Sul on <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> current, <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current, and potassium currents were examined in isolated single <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. RESULTS: In aconitine-induced <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> of rats, sulfamide <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> of changrolin (4, 5, and 6a-6p) exhibited various <span class=\"effect\">anti-arrhythmic</span> activities. The sulfate of <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> 6f (Sul) increased the amount of aconitine required to induce <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> in each treated animal. The ED₅₀ value of Sul in rats was 196 mg/kg. In ouabain-induced <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> of guinea pigs, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg doses of Sul increased the dose of ouabain required to induce VP, VT, and VF in a dose-dependent manner. In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> preparations, Sul produced a concentration-dependent decrease in APA and V(max), prolonged APD(90) and ERP, whereas RP was unaffected. In the spontaneously beating sinus nodes, Sul reduced APA and V(max) in a concentration-dependent manner. The whole-cell recording studies revealed that Sul produced a reversible reduction in I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) (IC₅₀=26.9 μmol/L) and I(Ca,L)(IC₅₀=69.2 μmol/L), whereas the inward rectifier (I(K1)) and the delayed rectifier potassium currents (I(K)) were unaffected. CONCLUSION: As a multi-ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>, Sul may have potent efficacy in anti-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>.</td>\n",

To investigate the hypothesis that (-)-menthol and icilin inhibit <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>currents (I(Ca,L)), the actions of the TRPM8 agonists on <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocyte I(Ca,L) were examined at near-physiological temperature (≈35°C) using whole-cell recording. Icilin (3-100 μM) did not significantly inhibit I(Ca,L). (3) in contrast, (-)-menthol concentration-dependently inhibited peak I(Ca,L) (IC(50)=74.6 μM; log(10)IC(50)(M)=-4.13±0.14). (-)-Menthol <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the late I(Ca,L) remaining at the end of depolarising pulses with greater efficacy (96.1±2.4% <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> at 1 mM) than peak I(Ca,L) (68.9±5.7% <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> at 1 mM, P<0.01), although there was no difference in <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of peak and late currents. <span class=\"other_terms\">Block</span> by (-)-menthol showed no voltage-dependence. The actions of (-)-menthol were compared with those of <span class=\"chemicals\">nimodipine</span>. <span class=\"chemicals\">Nimodipine</span> was a more efficacious (97.3±1.5 % <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> at 30 μM, P<0.01) and potent (IC(50)=0.74 μM; log(10)IC(50)(M)=-6.13±0.08, P<0.0001) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of peak I(Ca,L) than (-)-menthol. In contrast to (-)-menthol, <span class=\"chemicals\">nimodipine</span> showed greater <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> (IC(50)=0.056 μM; log(10)IC(50)(M)=-7.25±0.17, P<0.0001), but not greater efficacy, in <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of late compared with peak I(Ca,L). In summary, these data demonstrate that, at near-physiological temperature, (-) -menthol <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> I(Ca,L) at concentrations similar to those reportedly effective in TRPM8-agonism. The data suggest that the mechanism of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span><span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> by (-)-menthol differs from that of <span class=\"chemicals\">nimodipine</span>.</td>\n",

Among the processes leading to increased Ca(2+) influx, agonists of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+)-channel </span>can play an important role. Known pharmacological <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+)-channel </span>agonists act on different <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> sites on the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> protein, which may lead not only to enhanced peak currents, but also to distinct changes in other biophysical characteristics of the current. In this study, membrane currents were recorded with the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique in the whole-cell configuration in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes in combination with confocal fluorescence Ca(2+) imaging techniques and a variety of pharmacological tools. Testing a new positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> steroid-like <span class=\"chem\">compound</span>, we found that it increased the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+)-current by 2.5-fold by shifting the voltage-dependence of activation by 20.2 mV towards negative potentials. The dose-response relationship revealed two vastly different <span class=\"chem\">affinities</span> (EC(50(high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span>))=4.5+/-1.7 nM, EC(50(low-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span>))=8.0+/-1.1 microM) exhibiting differential pharmacological interactions with three classes of Ca(2+)-current <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span>, suggesting more than one <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site on the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> protein. Therefore, we identified and characterized a novel positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> (F90927) as a member of a new class of <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+)-channel </span>agonists exhibiting unique features, which set it apart from other presently known <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+)-channel </span>agonists.</td>\n",

For this we utilized a permanently charged <span class=\"chem\">compound</span>, SQ 32.428, out of a series of benzazepine drugs which have been characterized as competitive <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>. The non-permanently charged derivative SQ 32.910 was initially tested to <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiologically</span> establish Ca2+ <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> properties of benzazepines. Upon extracellular application, either <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> was able to completely <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> Ca2+ currents. At a stimulating frequency of 0.2 Hz <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> concentrations of SQ 32.910 and SQ 32.428 were determined as 35 nM and 15 microM, respectively. Intracellular application of SQ 32.428 was then compared to control experiments in the absence of drug. Initially, adequate drug dialysis was confirmed with 100 microM D890, which produced a progressive inhibition of Ca2+ currents within 10 min after whole-cell access. In contrast, internal application of 100 microM SQ 32.428 did not change time-course of Ca2+ currents compared to control run-down. These results show that the benzazepine/<span class=\"chemicals\">benzothiazepine</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> domain of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> is accessible only from the extracellular side and therefore suggest an extracellular location on the alpha 1-subunit of the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> protein.</td>\n",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of the <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> on various <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. AVE0118 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the <span class=\"species\">pig</span> Kv1.5 and the <span class=\"species\">human</span> Kv1.5 expressed in Xenopus oocytes with IC(50) values of 5.4+/-0.7 microM and 6.2+/-0.4 microM respectively. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, AVE0118 decreased the steady-state hKv1.5 current with an IC(50) of 1.1+/-0.2 microM. The hKv4.3/KChIP2.2 current in CHO cells was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by AVE0118 by accelerating the apparent time-constant of inactivation ( tau(inact)), and the integral current was inhibited with an IC(50) of 3.4+/-0.5 microM. At 10 microM AVE0118 tau(inact) decreased from 9.3+/-0.6 ms ( n=8, control) to 3.0+/-0.3 ms ( n=8). The K(ACh) current was investigated in isolated <span class=\"species\">pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes by application of 10 microM carbachol. At a clamp potential of -100 mV the I(KACh) was half-maximally <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by 4.5+/-1.6 microM AVE0118. In the absence of carbachol, AVE0118 had no effect on the inward current recorded at -100 mV. Effects on the I(Kr) current were investigated on HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> expressed in CHO cells.

Comparable results were obtained in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, where half-maximal inhibition of the I(Kr) tail current occurred at a similar concentration of AVE0118. Other ionic currents, like the I(Ks), I(KATP) (recorded in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes), and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) (recorded in <span class=\"species\">pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes) were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by 10 microM AVE0118 by 10+/-3% ( n=6), 28+/-7% ( n=4), and 22+/-13% ( n=5) respectively. In summary, AVE0118 preferentially inhibits the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> I(Kur), I(to) and I(KACH). This profile may explain the selective prolongation of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> refractoriness described previously in pigs and goats.</td>\n",

The most remarkable feature of <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> is its unique relative selectivity for T type <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, a property that has been proposed to explain in part the beneficial pharmacological and clinical profiles of this drug. In adrenal glomerulosa cells, aldosterone biosynthesis and secretion in response to angiotensin II or extracellular potassium is dependent on a sustained influx of Ca++ through T type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca++ channels</span>. The effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> on the steroidogenic function of glomerulosa cells was therefore investigated. Using the <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> technique, we found that <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> inhibits selectively and in a concentration-dependent manner (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 3 microM)++ T type currents in bovine glomerulosa cells. In addition to this <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span> (voltage independent) inhibition, the drug also induced a shift of the steady-state inactivation curve of these <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> toward hyperpolarized voltages, contributing to its efficacy to prevent Ca++ influx into the cell through T type <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Concomitantly, <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> reduced the cytosolic <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> responses to potassium and angiotensin II (as assessed with fluorescent probes), without affecting the capacitative Ca++ influx, and inhibited pregnenolone and aldosterone formation. This inhibition of steroidogenesis was not exclusively due to <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> action on voltage-operated <span class=\"calcium\">Ca++ channels</span>, because this agent also partially reduced steroid synthesis induced by adrenocorticotropic hormone or forskolin, two activators of the cyclic AMP pathway. In conclusion, <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> is highly effective in adrenal glomerulosa cells in reducing T type <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity and aldosterone biosynthesis, two actions that should contribute to the beneficial effect of the drug in the treatment of hypertension.</td>\n",

Isoprenaline (1-2000 nM) caused an inward shift of the holding current, in addition to increasing the inward <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (ICa). The effect on the background current was maximal earlier than the increase in ICa, but was of shorter duration. The magnitude of the background current was concentration dependent with a <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 8 nM. This current was unaffected by tetrodotoxin 20 microM, Cd 200 microM or <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, 10 microM and potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> (intracellular Cs, extracellular Cs 20 mM, Ba 2 mM or tetraethylammonium 10 mM). Lowering the chloride content of the electrode solution reduced the magnitude of the background current. The background current was also induced by histamine (1 or 10 microM). Adenosine (10-1000 microM) and and ATP (200 microM) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonised</span> the isoprenaline induced background current and the increase in ICa. The histamine effects on these currents were also reduced by adenosine. These results suggest that this background current may be carried by chloride ions and may be mediated via an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP concentration. <span class=\"other_terms\">Antagonism</span> of this current may contribute to the <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> actions of adenosine and ATP but their mechanisms of action are yet to be determined.</td>\n",

We applied tight-seal, whole-cell, <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques to assess the effects of indapamide on INa, Ito, ICa, and IKs in canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. Indapamide inhibited INa, Ito, and IKs in a concentration-dependent and reversible way, without altering ICa. <span class=\"other_terms\">Block</span> increased with depolarization, with the 50% <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>) decreasing from 129 +/- 26 micromol/L (at -60 mV) to 79 +/- 17 micromol/L (at -10 mV) for INa, from 174 +/- 19 micromol/L (at + 10 mV) to 98 +/- 7 micromol/L (at +60 mV) for Ito and from 148 +/- 28 micromol/L (at +10 mV) to 86 +/- 18 micromol/L (at +60 mV) for IKs. Significant inhibition was seen at concentrations as low as 10 micromol/L for all 3 currents. In addition, indapamide effectively inhibited the ultrarapid delayed rectifier current in a voltage-independent way, with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 138 +/- 7 micromol/L at +10 mV. Standard microelectrode experiments showed the effects of indapamide on the action potential to be consistent with the ionic actions seen. We conclude that in addition to its well-recognized IKs-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> action, indapamide also inhibits INa and Ito effectively and with similar <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>. Thus, indapamide is not a reliable pharmacological probe with which to study the specific effects of IKs <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>, and INa and Ito <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> may contribute to the potential profile of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> actions of the <span class=\"chem\">compound</span>.</td>\n",

ET-1 (> or =10 nM) suppressed the basal <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> to 79+/-8% of control at 20 nM. Bath application of isoproterenol (ISO; 10 nM) enhanced <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> to 192+/-28% with about a -10-mV shift of its relationship with membrane potential. ET-1 concentration dependently inhibited this ISO-enhanced <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> with a half-maximally <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of 168 pM. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> actions of ET-1 were <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonised</span> by BQ-123 (300 nM), cyclo(D-Asp-L-Pro-D-Val-L-Leu-D-Trp), a specific ETA receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>. Histamine-enhanced <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> was also suppressed by ET-1, but <span class=\"calcium\">ICa, L</span> potentiated by internal adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) was unaffected. Preincubation of myocytes with pertussis toxin (PTX, at 5 microgram/ml for >60 min at 36 degrees C) completely occluded the ET-1 action. Thus, stimulation of ETA receptors by subnanomolar ET-1 inhibits <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> via PTX-sensitive G-proteins.</td>\n",

The inhibition of I(AC) by <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> was independent of the membrane potential. <span class=\"chemicals\">Mibefradil</span> also reversibly <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span>, with similar <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>, unitary I(AC) currents recorded in outside-out membrane patches. An analysis of dwell time histograms indicated the presence of two closed and one open state. <span class=\"chemicals\">Mibefradil</span> (1 microM) increased the duration of the two closed time constants (tau(c1) and tau(c2)) from 2.30 +/- 0.18 and 27.9 +/- 4.7 ms to 4.32 +/- 0.61 and 62.5 +/- 13.8 ms, respectively, but did not alter the open time constant (tau(o)). <span class=\"chemicals\">Mibefradil</span> also failed to reduce the size of the unitary I(AC) current. A voltage-gated A-type K(+) current was also inhibited by <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> at concentrations approximately 10-fold higher than those required to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> I(AC) (IC(50) = 4.65 microM). These results identify <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> as a potent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of ATP-activated K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in adrenal zona fasciculata cells. It appears to function by stabilizing closed states of these <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. In contrast to its selective <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> may be a potent but less-selective K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>. In this regard, the <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> may produce some of the toxicity associated with <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> pharmacology.</td>\n",

We examined effects of capsaicin (10(-9) - 10(-5) M), a pungent agent extracted from red pepper, on the contractile tension of <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles stimulated at various cycle lengths (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 sec). 2. Capsaicin produced a marked concentration-dependent decrease in the amplitude, the rate of rise (dp/dt) and the rate of relaxation (dr/dt) of the tension. 3. However, the half relaxation time and the time to peak tension of the tension were slightly affected by the agent. 4. The negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect of capsaicin was stimulus cycle length (CL) dependent. In particular, <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> (50% inhibitive concentration) of the agent in the amplitude of the tension was stimulus CL dependent. That is, the values of <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> were around 10(-7) M at longer CLs (1, 2 and 5 sec), and the value of <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> at CL 0.2 sec was 4 x 10(-6) M. 5. These capsaicin-induced negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effects were reversible. Other studies from our laboratory show that the negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effects may be largely due to a decrease in Ca2+ current.</td>\n",

Although associated with <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> effects in animal models in vivo, there is no published information concerning the effects of sipatrigine on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion currents and action potentials (AP). The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of sipatrigine on the delayed rectifier currents (I(Kr) and I(Ks)), the inward rectifier current (I(K1)), the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (I(Ca,L)) and the fast <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ current (I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>)), as well as on AP duration at 30% (APD30) and 90% (APD90) repolarization, in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Each of the currents was inhibited by sipatrigine, demonstrating the drug to be a relatively broad-spectrum <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of cation <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. However, sipatrigine was a comparatively more potent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of I(Kr) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 0.85 micromol/L) and I(Ks) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 0.92 micromol/L) than of I(K1) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 5.3 micromol/L), I(Ca,L) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 6.0 micromol/L) and I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 25.5 micromol/L). Consistent with <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(Kr), I(Ks) and I(K1), sipatrigine (1-30 micromol/L) produced a concentration-dependent prolongation of APD90. Although lower concentrations of sipatrigine (< or = 3 micromol/L) caused APD(30) prolongation, higher concentrations (> or = 10 micromol/L) shortened APD30, consistent with an involvement of I(Ca,L) <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>. The contrasting effects of sipatrigine on APD30 and APD90 at higher concentrations resulted in a marked concentration-dependent triangulation of the AP. 5. The results of the present study demonstrate that sipatrigine, at concentrations previously shown to be neuroprotective in vitro, modulates <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> K+, Ca2+ and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ currents and repolarization of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> action potential.</td>\n",

The objective of the present study was to determine whether transient outward current (I(to)), ultra-rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Kur)), and rapid and slow delayed rectifier K(+) currents (I(Kr) and I(Ks)) were present in <span class=\"species\">pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>. The whole-cell patch technique was applied to record membrane currents and action potentials in myocytes isolated from <span class=\"species\">pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>. It was found that an I(to) was activated upon depolarization voltage steps to between -10 and +60 mV from -50 mV in <span class=\"species\">pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells, and the I(to) was sensitive to the inhibition by the <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> (Ca(2+)) current, showed a \"bell-shaped\" I-V relationship, typical of I(to2) (i.e. I(Cl.Ca)). The I(to2) was inhibited by the chloride (Cl(-)) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9-AC, 200 micromol/l) or 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilben-2,2'disulfonic acid (200 micromol/l), and by Cl(-) substitution in the superfusate. I(Kur) was found in <span class=\"species\">pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes, and the current showed properties of weak inward rectification and use- and frequency-dependent reduction. I(Kur) was resistant to tetraethylammonium, but sensitive to inhibition by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) (IC(50) = 71.7 +/- 3.5 micromol/l). In addition, <span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span>-sensitive I(Kr) and chromanol 293B-sensitive I(Ks) were observed in <span class=\"species\">pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. <span class=\"other_terms\">Blockade</span> of I(to2), I(Kur), I(Kr) or I(Ks) with corresponding <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> significantly prolonged <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> action potentials.

In order to define the <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> mechanism(s) responsible for bradykinin (BK)-induced positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> and chronotropic responses in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> atria, effects of BK on the membrane currents were examined in isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells using <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> techniques. 2. BK (0.1-1000 nM) increased the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (I(Ca)), which was recorded from enzymatically-dissociated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes by the nystatin-perforated patch method, in a concentration-dependent fashion, and the calculated <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value for increasing I(Ca) was 5.2 nM. In conventional ruptured patch experiments, BK inhibited the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-operated K+ current (I(K.ACh)) that was activated by the muscarinic agonist carbachol (1 microM) with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value of 0.57 nM. Both the increase in I(Ca) and the decrease in I(K.ACh) were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by HOE140, a selective bradykinin B2 receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>. 3. The BK-induced inhibition of I(K.ACh) was significantly attenuated by staurosporine and calphostin C, protein kinase C <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span>. In addition, the I(K.ACh) inhibition by BK was also attenuated by the tyrosine kinase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span> or tyrphostin but not by daidzein, an inactive <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span> of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>. However, neither protein kinase C <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> nor tyrosine kinase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> affected the BK-induced increase in I(Ca). 4. In the presence and absence of muscarinic stimulation, BK prolonged the action potential recorded from the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells in the current clamp mode. 5. We conclude that BK increases I(Ca) and decreases I(K.ACh) in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells, resulting in positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> and chronotropic responses in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> preparations. Protein kinase C activation, and possibly tyrosine kinase activation, may be involved in the B2-receptor-mediated I(K.ACh) inhibition.</td>\n",

The 1,4-<span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> [3H]PN 200-110 bound to polarized cells (5.8 mM K+) with a KD value of 3.53 X 10(-9) M and a Bmax value of 50.1 fmol/mg of protein. In depolarized cells (50 mM K+), a KD value of 6.33 X 10(-11) M was found, reflecting a 55-fold increase in <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span>; Bmax did not change upon depolarization. Dissociation rates (k-1) of [3H]PN 200-110 <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> were faster in polarized cells (0.53 min-1) than in depolarized cells (0.018 min-1), but association rates (k1 of 2.17 X 10(8) and 2.27 X 10(8) min-1M-1 were not different in polarized and depolarized cells. The KD values calculated from the ratio of k-1/k1 accorded well with those determined from equilibrium <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> assays. The enantiomers of Bay K 8644 and 202-791 and a series of <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> <span class=\"chem\">analogs</span> inhibited specific <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of [3H]PN 200-110 in depolarized cells. In polarized cells, the <span class=\"chem\">affinities</span> of the S-enantiomers (activators) were close to those in depolarized cells; however, the <span class=\"chem\">affinities</span> of R-enantiomers (<span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span>) were 50- to 65-fold lower. The effects of both (S)- and (R)-Bay K 8644 on [3H]PN 200-110 <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> were mediated through increased apparent KD values, without changes in Bmax and nH. In depolarized cells, l-D600 and d-D600 partially inhibited [3H]PN 200-110 <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to a maximum of 71% and 56%, respectively; in polarized cells, l-D600 (d-D600 not measured) was ineffective on [3H]PN 200-110 <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>. d-(cis)-<span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span>, but not l-(cis)-<span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>, partially inhibited (maximum 30%) specific <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of [3H]PN 200-110 in depolarized cells, but potentiated (maximum 79%) <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> in polarized cells. The potentiating effect of d-(cis)-<span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> was mediated through an increase in <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> without change in Bmax of [3H]PN 200-110 <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>. (S)-Bay K 8644 potentiated 45Ca2+ uptake into the cells, with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value of 4.26 X 10(-10) M; concentrations higher than 10(-7) M were <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span>, producing a biphasic concentration-response relationship. (R)-Bay K 8644 inhibited 80 mM K+-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value of 2.11 X 10(-9) M.

To investigate the contribution of each beta-AR subtype in AC and CaCh coupling, we stably expressed <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> CaCh alpha1 and beta2 subunits along with either beta1-AR or beta2-AR in CHW fibroblasts. Co-expression of either beta-AR with CaCh subunits conferred responsiveness of AC and CaCh to isoproterenol (ISO), which was not observed in non-transfected cells. ISO-promoted cAMP formation occurred at a lower <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> through the beta2-AR than through the beta1-AR (0.13 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.14 nM). In contrast, activation of CaCh was more efficacious via the beta1-AR than the beta2-AR (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for CaCh activation = 238 +/- 33 vs. 1057 +/- 113 nM). Pre-treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) had no effect upon the responsiveness of either cAMP formation or CaCh activation through either receptor. We conclude (1) that beta1-ARs exhibit preferential coupling to CaCh activation, versus that observed for the beta2-AR; (2) that this preferential coupling cannot be explained solely by cAMP-dependent processes; and (3) that the relative attenuation of beta2-AR-promoted CaCh activation is not due to receptor coupling to PTX-sensitive G proteins. Thus, it is likely that other subtype-specific, cAMP-independent coupling of the beta-AR to CaCh is present.</td>\n",

The fast <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ current (iNa) was activated by ramp pulses from various holding potentials of -90, -80 or -60 mV to 10 mV with various intervals. At 0.2 Hz, JTV-519 inhibited iNa in a concentration-dependent manner with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of approximately 1.2 and 2 microM at the holding potential of -60 and -90 mM, respectively, implicating a <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>. Increasing the pulse frequency from 1 to 2 or 3.3 Hz in the presence of 1 microM JTV-519 shortened the time-course and increased the level of iNa <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, indicating a frequency-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>. The time-course of iNa <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> by JTV-519 was slower than that of lidocaine and similar to that of <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span>. Ca2+ current (iCa) and the inwardly rectifying K+ current (iK1) were also inhibited by JTV-519. JTV-519 decreased the duration and the height of the plateau of the action potential. We conclude that JTV-519 has frequency- and <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effects on iNa as well as inhibition of iCa and iK1.</td>\n",

It has been known to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> a variety of ion currents. This study is designed to determine the effect of this drug on ion currents in differentiated H9c2 <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cells. The effects of propofol, an intravenous anesthetic agent with a distinct <span class=\"chem\">chemical</span> structure, on ion currents of differentiated clonal <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> (H9c2) cells were investigated in this study. Propofol (10-300 microM) suppressed the amplitude of delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(K(DR))) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 36 microM. This <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> reduced activation time constant and increased current inactivation, although no voltage dependency of propofol-induced <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(K(DR)) can demonstrated. Neither diazoxide, pinacidil, nor caffeic acid phenethyl ester had any effect on propofol-induced <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(K(DR)). Propofol (30 microM) had no effect on erg-mediated K(+) current in these cells; however, it suppressed <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> and skeletal types to a similar extent. Intracellular dialysis with propofol (100 microM) had no effects on I(K(DR)) or I(Ca,L). Numerical simulations of I(K(DR)) based on a Markovian model reproduce the experimental results and show that propofol-induced <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of I(K(DR)) is associated with an decrease in forward rate of the activation process and an increase in transitional rate into the inactivated state. Propofol can suppress I(K(DR)) in differentiated H9c2 <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cells in a concentration- and state-dependent manner. These effects can significantly contribute its action on functional activity of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> cells.</td>\n",

METHODS: Single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes were prepared by enzymatic dispersion. Whole-cell current and <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> techniques were used to monitor membrane potentials and I(Ca). RESULTS: Ropivacaine (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) reduced the overshoot and shortened the duration of the action potential. Hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential was observed in the presence of ropivacaine (10(-4) M). Ropivacaine (10(-5)-10(-3) M) reduced I(Ca) dose-dependently and reversibly, and the 50% <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration (IC(50)) of ropivacaine was estimated as 4.3 x 10(-4) M. Furthermore, the inhibition of I(Ca) was not a <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>. CONCLUSION: Ropivacaine has an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on I(Ca) in the <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocyte. It is concluded that the mild negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect induced by ropivacaine can be attributed in part to shortening of the duration of the action potential, which is caused by inhibition of I(Ca).</td>\n",

NS-21 is a newly developed drug for the treatment of urinary frequency and urinary incontinence and it has pharmacological properties similar to those of <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span>. It remains unknown, however, whether NS-21 and its active metabolite, RCC-36, have any proarrhythmic activity. The <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> properties of NS-21 and RCC-36 were examined in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes and were compared with those of <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span> using the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. NS-21, RCC-36 and <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span> inhibited <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ currents in a concentration-dependent manner with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of 27.0, 27.0 and 33.5 microM, respectively. At a concentration of 10 microM, <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span> inhibited both the time-dependent current and the tail current of the delayed rectifier K+ current, with the latter being significantly inhibited at voltages more positive than +10 mV. In contrast, NS-21 and RCC-36 had almost no effect on either of these currents. <span class=\"chemicals\">Terodiline</span> also inhibited the inward rectifier K+ current significantly at voltages more negative than -100 mV, whereas NS-21 and RCC-36 had little effect. If the proarrhythmic activity of <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span> resulted primarily from the combined inhibition of K+ and Ca2+ currents, one might expect that NS-21 and RCC-36, which inhibit <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ currents without affecting either the delayed rectifier K+ current or the inward rectifier K+ current, would not share the proarrhythmic activities of <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span>.</td>\n",

In contrast to forskolin, the derivative contains a tetrahydrofuran rather than a tetrahydropyran moiety. (13R)-spiroforskolin activated I(Cl(CAMP)) in 58% of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes studied. The concentration required for the half maximal effect (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value) amounted to 9.6x10(-11) M and was lower than the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value for forskolin (2.4x10(-8) M). (13R)-spiroforskolin evoked a smaller maximal I(Cl(cAMP)) amplitude than forskolin. The rundown of the (13R)-spiroforskolin-activated I(Cl(cAMP)) was faster than that of the forskolin-induced current. Neither forskolin nor (13R)-spiroforskolin in maximally effective concentrations increased I(Cl(cAMP)) in cells containing high concentrations of cAMP. Furthermore, as an activator of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> I(Ca,L) (13R)-spiroforskolin displayed a smaller activation and a lower <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value (5.8x10(-10) M) than forskolin (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value: 3.7x10(-7) M). The effect of (13R)-spiroforskolin was observed in only 30% of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells studied. None of the drugs exerted a stimulatory effect in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells containing a high [cAMP]. The washout of the drug effect was significantly faster in (13R)-spiroforskolin- than in forskolin-treated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. We conclude that (13R)-spiroforskolin as a forskolin derivative displays unique characteristics. It is a more potent but less efficacious activator of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ionic conductances than the parent <span class=\"chem\">compound</span>. The results suggest that (13R)-spiroforskolin, like forskolin, most probably exerts its effects via stimulation of the adenylyl cyclase.</td>\n",

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique and radioligand-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> methods were used to analyse the effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">anandamide</span> in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. KEY RESULTS: In the presence of 1-10 μM AEA, suppression of both <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> was observed. Inhibition of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> was voltage and Pertussis toxin (PTX) - independent. Radioligand-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> studies indicated that specific <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of [(3) H] batrachotoxin (BTX) to <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> muscle membranes was also inhibited significantly by 10 μM metAEA, a non-metabolized AEA <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span>, with a marked decrease in Bmax values but no change in Kd . Further studies on <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> indicated that AEA potently inhibited these <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> 0.1 μM) in a voltage- and PTX-independent manner. AEA inhibited maximal amplitudes without affecting the kinetics of Ba(2+) currents. MetAEA also inhibited <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) currents. Radioligand studies indicated that specific <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of [(3) H]<span class=\"chemicals\">isradipine</span>, was inhibited significantly by metAEA. (10 μM), changing Bmax but not Kd . CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Results indicate that AEA inhibited the function of <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, independent of CB1 and CB2 receptor activation.</td>\n",

We examined the effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> on a rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> (designated fHK) cloned from <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. <span class=\"chemicals\">Verapamil</span> inhibited 86Rb+ efflux from fHK-transfected <span class=\"species\">human</span> embryonic kidney cells with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 4.5 x 10(-5) M. Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> experiments revealed that <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> induced a rapid component of fHK current inactivation but was without effect on activation. The effect was concentration and <span class=\"effect\">voltage dependent</span> and was attributed to open <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>. The apparent association and dissociation rate constants measured at +50 mV were about 1.65 x 10(5) M-1 sec-1 and 3.48 sec-1, respectively. S6 of fHK has significant homology to that portion of the <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site identified in <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>, and S6 is thought to form part of the inner mouth of K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> pores.

Mol. Cell. <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">Cardiol</span>. 24 (Suppl. V):102 (1992)]. Because cGS-PDE was found to mediate the cGMP-induced inhibition of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (Ica) in frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells, we tested the effects of EHNA in this preparation. Ica was measured using the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique and a perfusing pipette. EHNA (0.3-30 microM) had no significant effect on either basal Ica or isoprenaline (1 nM)- or cAMP (10 microM)-elevated Ica. However, EHNA dose-dependently (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> approximately 3 microM) reversed the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of cGMP on cAMP-stimulated Ica. EHNA (30 microM) also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of NO donors, such as <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> nitroprusside (1 mM) and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (30 microM), on isoprenaline-stimulated Ica. In addition, EHNA dose-dependently (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> approximately 4-5 microM) inhibited the cGMP-induced stimulation of PDE activity in frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricle</span> particulate fraction, as well as purified soluble cGS-PDE. However, EHNA (up to 30 microM) did not modify the activities of three other purified soluble PDE isoforms. Moreover, EHNA did not change the Ka (40 nM) for cGMP activation of cGS-PDE, which suggests that EHNA does not inhibit cGS-PDE by <span class=\"chem\">displacing</span> cGMP from the allosteric regulator site. Because adenosine did not mimic the effects of EHNA on Ica or PDE activity, it is unlikely that the effects of EHNA are due to adenosine deaminase inhibition. We conclude that EHNA acts primarily to inhibit cGS-PDE in intact <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes. This <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> should be useful in evaluating the physiological role of cGS-PDE in various tissues.</td>\n",

With the use of <span class=\"species\">pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes and the whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique, we examined the possibility that cation efflux via <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> underlies these currents. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) and extracellular Mg(2+) induced time-independent currents at all potentials and time-dependent currents at potentials greater than -50 mV. Either K(+) or Cs(+) could carry the time-dependent currents, with reversal potential of +8 mV with internal K(+) and +34 mV with Cs(+). Activation and inactivation were <span class=\"effect\">voltage dependent</span> [Boltzmann distributions with potential of half-maximal value (V(1/2)) = -24 mV and slope = -9 mV for activation; V(1/2) = -58 mV and slope = 13 mV for inactivation].

We conclude that the I(to)-like currents are due to monovalent cation flow through <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span>, which in <span class=\"species\">pig</span> myocytes show low sensitivity to <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>.</td>\n",

It has been reported that allitridi, an active <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> extracted from garlic, has many <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> effects. However, it remains unknown whether allitridi affects major repolarization currents, such as the transient outward K(+) current (I(to) ), ultrarapid delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kur)) and the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)), in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. 2. In the present study, we investigated the effects of allitridi on I(to), I(Kur), I(Ca) and the action potential in <span class=\"species\">human</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes using the whole-cell patch recording technique. 3. Allitridi reversibly inhibited I(to), but not I(Kur) and I(Ca), in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. These effects of allitridi on I(to) were concentration dependent (IC(50) = 44.9 μmol/L). Inactivation of I(to) was accelerated and the <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> inactivation potential was shifted towards the negative direction. Allitridi (30 μmol/L) significantly prolonged action potential duration in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. 4. The results of the present study indicate that allitridi inhibits I(to), but not I(Kur) and I(Ca), and prolongs the action potential duration in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes.</td>\n",

To test for a possible direct effect of extracellular ATP on <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span>, single <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were reconstituted from porcine sarcolemma into planar lipid bilayers so that intracellular signaling pathways could be controlled. Extracellular ATP (2-100 microM) increased the open probability of the reconstituted <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, with a maximal increase of approximately 2.6-fold and an EC(50) of 3.9 microM. The increase in open probability was due to an increase in <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> availability and a decrease in <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> inactivation rate. Other nucleotides displayed a rank order of effectiveness of ATP > alpha,beta-methylene-ATP > 2-methylthio-ATP > UTP > adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) >> ADP; adenosine had no effect. Several <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> of P2 receptors had no impact on the ATP-dependent increase in open probability, indicating that receptor activation was not required. These results suggest that extracellular ATP and other nucleotides can stimulate the activity of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> via a direct interaction with the <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.</td>\n",

The rank order of <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>'s for Ca2+ <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(Li) was: E677K > E1086K > E334K > E1387K > D1391K > or approximately wild-type. The order of <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>'s for Mg2+ <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(Li) indicated differential involvement of the same residues in Mg2+ <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>: E 1387K > E334K > E1086K > E677K > D 1391K = wild-type. Mutants E1387K and D1391K effectively permeated Ba2+, but exhibited a decreased single-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> conductance. The unitary current amplitude carried by <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+, in the absence of external divalent cations, was slightly decreased in the E1387K mutant but not in the D1391K mutant. The results confirm that each of the four glutamates participate unequally in high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> Ca2+ <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>. Additionally, our results indicate that these glutamate residues participate in Mg2+ <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>. The glutamate at position 1387 may be only peripherally involved in the formation of a high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> Ca2+ -<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site but is central to a Mg2+ <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site accessible from the external side of the pore. The aspartate at position 1391 is most likely located just external to the selectivity region.</td>\n",

Ca++ and K+ currents were studied in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ currents were studied in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells from cultured neonatal <span class=\"species\">rat</span>; these cells are more suitable for <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ current measurements than are <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells from <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span>. Under current clamp conditions, ICS 205-930 at 3 x 10(-5) M prolonged the action potential plateau and increased its amplitude of <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> cell. The effect was reversible. Increasing the concentration to 3 x 10(-4) M shortened the plateau, reduced its amplitude and depolarized the resting membrane potential. The effects between 10(-7) and 10(-3) M were examined under <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> conditions. ICS 205-930 produced a concentration-dependent suppression of inwardly rectifying K+ currents with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 1.95 x 10(-5) M at a test potential of -40 mV. The effects were time-and <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> and the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> increased to 1.16 x 10(-4) M at -100 mV. The time-dependent outward current and the time-dependent outward tail currents upon repolarization to between -10 and -30 mV also were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by the drug in a concentration-dependent manner with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 3.7 x 10(-5) M. Ca++ currents and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ currents also were inhibited in the presence of higher concentration of ICS 205-930 (greater than 10(-4) M), although <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> was stronger on <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ currents.

The evoked tritium overflow was almost abolished by 0.2 microM omega-CTx GVIA (a selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of N-type <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>). It is concluded that noradrenaline release from <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> sympathetic nerves is triggered by Ca2+-influx via N-type, but not <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span>, <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> and that the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> at clinically relevant concentrations on noradrenaline release is probably due to its <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> action on N-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>. This property of <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> is unique among the therapeutically applied <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> and may contribute to the slight negative chronotropic effect of the drug in vivo.</td>\n",

Acute application of free OA caused a dose-dependent depression of the whole-cell barium current that was evoked by a voltage step to 0 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV. The derived 50% <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) was 12.49+/-0.27 micromol l(-1). At a concentration of 30 micromol l(-1), OA significantly reduced the current density to about 45% of control values, but did not modify either the shape of the current-density voltage relationship or the apparent reversal potential. In addition, OA did not modify the voltage dependence of either steady state inactivation or activation curves. Taken together, these results indicate that physiological concentrations of free OA decrease the conductance of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> inward current, without altering its properties of selectivity and its voltage dependence. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of OA upon the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> may translate, in vivo, into a protective effect against <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> induced by Ca2+ overload.</td>\n",

The whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> was used for studying the effects of various beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor agonists and <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> (Ica) in frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. 2. Dose-response curves for the effects of isoprenaline (non selective beta-agonist), salbutamol (beta2-agonist), dobutamine (beta1-agonist) on ICa were obtained in the absence and presence of various concentrations of ICI 118551 (beta2-<span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>), metoprolol (beta1-<span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>) and xamoterol (partial beta1-agonist) to derive <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> (i.e. the concentration of beta-agonist at which the response was 50% of the maximum) and Emax (the maximal response) values by use of a Michaelis equation. Schild regression analysis was performed to examine whether the <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> were competitive and to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(B)) for the <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>-receptor complex. 3. Isoprenaline increased ICa with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 20.0 nM and an Emax of 597%. ICI 118551 and metoprolol competitively antagonized the effect of isoprenaline with a K(B) of 3.80 nM and 207 nM, respectively. 4. Salbutamol increased ICa with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 290 nM and an Emax of 512%. ICI 118551 and metoprolol competitively antagonized the effect of salbutamol with a K(B) of 1.77 nM and 456 nM, respectively. 5. Dobutamine increased ICa with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 2.40 microM and an Emax of 265%. ICI 118551 and metoprolol competitively antagonized the effect of dobutamine with a K(B) of 2.84 nM and 609 nM, respectively. 6. Xamoterol had no stimulating effect on ICa. However, xamoterol competitively antagonized the stimulating effects of isoprenaline, salbutamol and dobutamine on ICa with a K(B) of 58-64 nM. 7. We conclude that a single population of receptors is involved in the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated regulation of ICa in frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. The pharmacological pattern of the response of ICa to the different beta-adrenoceptor agonists and <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> tested suggests that these receptors are of the beta2-subtype.</td>\n",

METHODS: Bullfrog single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes were prepared by enzymatic dispersion. Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> technique and current clamp technique were used to monitor I(Ca), membrane resting potential, and action potential. RESULTS: Ketamine (10(-5)-10(-3) M) showed dose-dependent inhibition of I(Ca) in a reversible manner. The 50% <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration (IC(50)) of ketamine on I(Ca) was estimated to be 0.92 x 10(-5) M. <span class=\"effect\">Use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(Ca) was not observed. The resting membrane potential was depolarized at a high concentration (10(-4) M) of ketamine. Reduction of the plateau phase and prolonged duration of the action potential were observed in the presence of a high concentration of ketamine (10(-4) M). CONCLUSION: Ketamine has an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on I(Ca) in the bullfrog single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocyte, and a high dose (10(-4) M) of ketamine prolonges the duration of the action potential. The mechanism of inhibition of I(Ca) seems to be a direct effect on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span>, not like an open <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>.</td>\n",

In <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> sino-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> (SA) node cells the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(K)) is composed of rapidly and slowly activating components of I(K) (I(Kr) and I(Ks), respectively). The present study was undertaken to characterize the <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> action of the chromanol derivative 293B on I(Ks) in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> SA node cells using whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. 2. Bath application of 293B <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(Ks), elicited by 4-s depolarizing voltage pulses from a holding potential of -50 mV, under conditions in which the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) and I(Kr) were inhibited; the effect was concentration-dependent with an IC(50) of 5.3 microM, when evaluated by the decrease in the amplitude of I(Ks) tail current following 4-s depolarizing voltage steps to +50 mV. 3. The 293B <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(Ks) progressed with time during depolarizing voltage steps with a more rapid <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> at higher concentrations. 4. The <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(Ks) by 293B was fully reversed within a few minutes after washing off the drug, even when a maximal effect (a nearly full <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>) was achieved at high drug concentration (50 microM). 5. Bath application of 293B at 50 microM greatly and reversibly reduced the amplitude of I(Ks) which is maximally stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (1 microM), while the degree of 293B <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of the isoprenaline-stimulated I(Ks) was slightly but significantly smaller than that of non-stimulated I(Ks) (94.0+/-0.98% <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, n=6 vs 99.4+/-0.45% <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, n=6; P<0.01). 6. We conclude that, in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> SA node cells (i) 293B is a potent and fully reversible <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of I(Ks) in control and during beta-adrenergic stimulation and (ii) <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> with 293B occurs in a time-dependent manner during depolarizing voltage steps.</td>\n",

Initial attempts to inhibit renin in humans have faced numerous difficulties. Molecular modelling and X-ray crystallography of the active site of renin have led to the development of new orally active renin <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span>, such as aliskiren. 2. Aliskiren has a low bioavailability (between 2.6 and 5.0%) compensated by its high <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> to inhibit renin (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>: 0.6 nmol/L) and a long plasma half-life (23-36 h), which makes it suitable for once-daily dosing. 3. The once-daily administration of aliskiren to hypertensive patients lowers BP as strongly as standard doses of established angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> (losartan, valsartan, irbesartan), hydrochlorothiazide, angiotensin converting enzyme <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> (ramipril and lisinopril) or long acting <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> (<span class=\"chemicals\">amlodipine</span>). In combination therapy, aliskiren further decreases blood pressure when combined with either hydrochlorothiazide, <span class=\"chemicals\">amlodipine</span>, irbesartan or ramipril. 4. The biochemical consequences of renin inhibition differ from those of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and Ang II <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonism</span>, particularly in terms of angiotensin profiles and interactions with the bradykinin-nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway and possibly the (pro)renin receptor. 5. <span class=\"other_terms\">Blockade</span> of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) with ACE <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span>, AT1 receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> or a combination of these drugs has become one of the most successful therapeutic approaches in medicine. However, it remains unclear how to optimize RAS <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> to maximize <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> and renal benefits. In this context, renin inhibition to render the RAS fully quiescent is a new possibility requiring further study.</td>\n",

Chemotherapy with trivalent potassium antimony tartrate (PAT) and, more importantly, pentavalent antimony-carbohydrate complexes, such as <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> stibogluconate (SSG), has been reported to prolong the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval and produce life-threatening <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>. PAT is chemically related to As2O3, which alters <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> excitability by inhibition of <span class=\"species\">human</span> ether a-go-go related gene (hERG) trafficking and an increase of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents. In this study, we report that PAT does not <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> hERG currents on short-term exposure but reduces current density on long-term exposure (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>, 11.8 microM) and inhibits hERG maturation on Western blots (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>, 62 microM). Therapeutic concentrations of 0.3 microM PAT increase <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents from -4.8 +/- 0.7 to -7.3 +/- 0.5 pA/pF at 10 mV. In marked contrast, pentavalent SSG, the drug of choice for the treatment of leishmaniasis, did not affect hERG/IKr or any other <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> potassium current at therapeutic concentrations. However, both <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> and <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents were significantly increased on long-term exposure to 30 microM SSG in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. We propose that the increase in <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents from -3.2 +/- 0.3 to -5.1 +/- 0.3 pA/pF at 10 mV prolongs APD90 from 464 +/- 35 to 892 +/- 64 ms. Our data suggest that conversion of Sb(V) into active Sb(III) in patients produces a common mode of action for antimonial drugs, which define a novel <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> class that increases <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> risk not by a reduction of hERG/IKr currents but-for the first time-by an increase in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents.</td>\n",

We investigated the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects of brompheniramine, a conventional antihistamine. Brompheniramine was reported to prolong <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval in isolated hearts. To evaluate the <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects of brompheniramine, we used whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> techniques in <span class=\"species\">human</span> ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)-stably transfected CHO cells, the SCN5A <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> transiently transfected CHO cells, and <span class=\"species\">rat</span> myocytes and conventional microelectrode recording techniques in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles. As for the I(hERG), the IC(50) value of brompheniramine was found to be 0.90+/-0.14microM with a Hill coefficient (n(H)) of 1.75+/-0.42. Action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) was slightly prolonged by brompheniramine at 10 and 100microM, but APD(50) was shortened by 100microM. Moreover, despite the potent hERG current <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, reductions of the V(max) and total amplitude of action potential were observed at high concentrations of brompheniramine. The change in action potential parameters and poor correlations between hERG and APD assay indicated additional effects of brompheniramine on non-hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. In agreement with this hypothesis, the inhibition of I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) (IC(50) values: 21.26+/-2.52microM) and I(Ca) (IC(50) values: 16.12+/-9.43microM) by brompheniramine was observed. The results of this study suggest that brompheniramine may possess classes III, Ib and IV properties, especially at high concentrations and that additional studies on non-hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> will be necessary to elucidate the complex <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects of brompheniramine on the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>.</td>\n",

The goal of the present study was to investigate the regulation by 5-HT of voltage-gated <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes and to characterize the receptor involved. <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">Cardiomyocytes</span> isolated enzymatically and mechanically were <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamped</span> using the whole-cell configuration of the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. Extracellular perfusion of 5-HT increased Ca2+ current (ICa) amplitude with a <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> (0.1 microM) similar to that observed with isoprenaline. The effects of 5-HT were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by the addition of protein kinase A <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> in the pipette. In addition, the effects of 5-HT, isoprenaline, and intracellular cAMP on ICa were not additive. These results support the hypothesis that the <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect of 5-HT in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes is related to an increase of ICa via an elevation of intracellular cAMP levels and stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The effects of 5-HT were not <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> of 5-HT1 (methiothepin), 5-HT2 (ketanserin), or 5-HT3 (ICS 205-930 at a low concentration) receptors. The benzamide derivatives renzapride and zacopride and the azabicyclobenzimidazolone derivative BIMU 8 increased ICa, but less efficiently than did 5-HT or 5-methoxytryptamine. Moreover, ICS 205-930 at high concentrations (greater than 1 microM) completely antagonized the effects of 5-HT. Thus, the pharmacology of the 5-HT receptor involved in an increase of ICa in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes resembles that recently described for the 5-HT4 receptor. In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes dissociated from <span class=\"species\">rat</span>, <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span>, <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span>, or frog, 5-HT at high concentrations had no effect on Ca2+ currents, suggesting that the distribution of 5-HT4 receptors in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> tissues is species dependent.</td>\n",

There was a large difference in negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> between the two enantiomers in cultured chick embryo <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells: the (+) enantiomer was 140 fold more potent (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 1.1 +/- 0.2 nM) than the (-) enantiomer (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 160 +/- 20 nM). (+) PN 200-110 was 10 fold more potent than (-) PN 200-110 in lowering blood pressure after intravenous injection and only three fold more potent after intra-cerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.) into pentobarbital-anaesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats. I.c.v. administered (+) PN 200-110 (1 microgram/kg) partially antagonized the hypertensive response to i.c.v. administered BAY K 8644 (30 micrograms/kg), a <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> agonist, while the same dose of the (-) enantiomer did not change the i.c.v. BAY-induced increase in blood pressure. These results suggest that the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, PN 200-110, may act centrally and stereoselectively at the level of the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> receptor sites involved in the control of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.</td>\n",

Torsades de pointes (<span class=\"effect\">TDP</span>) is a severe adverse effect during the clinical use of <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span>, a selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> (I(Kr)). The present study was designed to test whether CPU228, a derivative of <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span> with <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> (Ca(2+)) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> properties, could reduce <span class=\"effect\">TDP</span> without reducing the <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of I(Kr). 2. The incidence of <span class=\"effect\">TDP</span> in a <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> model and the effective refractory period (ERP) were measured and compared for <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span> and CPU228. Suppression of I(Kr) and the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) and the Ca(2+) transients of isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> were investigated by whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> and Fluo-3 dye spectrophotometry. 3. The incidence of <span class=\"effect\">TDP</span> was greatly reduced by CPU228 relative to <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span>, occurring in only one of six rabbits compared with five of six rabbits following <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span> (P < 0.05). In isolated atria, prolongation of ERP by CPU228 was less than that of <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span> and no reverse frequency dependence was observed. Negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropism</span> by CPU228 was significant against positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropism</span> by <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span>. CPU228 inhibited both I(Kr) and I(Ca,L) currents and the IC(50) for I(Ca,L) inhibition was 0.909 micromol/L. At 3 micromol/L, CPU228 significantly suppressed the Ca(2+) transients. 4. CPU228 is able to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> I(Ca,L), contributing to decreased <span class=\"effect\">TDP</span>, while also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> I(Kr) activity. By combined <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of I(Kr) and I(Ca,L), CPU228 shares the property of complex Class III <span class=\"effect\">anti-arrhythmic</span> agents.</td>\n",

This work focused on the expression pattern of voltage-gated <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> (VGCC). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that HL-1 cells have mRNA for several types of <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> including the L-types, alpha1C and alpha1D, as well as T-types, alpha1H and alpha1G, but are lacking N-type, alpha1B and the T-type, alpha1I. Western blot analysis demonstrated significant alpha1C protein subunit expression, with less alpha1D subunit apparent, while alpha1A, alpha1B and alpha1E subunit expression was undetectable. Immunocytochemical staining showed that the alpha1C protein subunit is expressed predominantly on the cell surface, whereas the alpha1D protein is expressed mostly intracellularly. Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> measurements demonstrated the presence of low (ICa,T) and high (<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>) voltage-activated Ca2+ currents, with preferential sensitivity to <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">nimodipine</span>, respectively. Addition of increasing external Ca2+ concentrations, [Ca2+]o, resulted in Ca2+ influx measured by fluorometric imaging with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 0.8 mM [Ca2+]o. At a fixed [Ca2+]o of 0.125 mM, Ca2+ influx was also triggered by increasing the extracellular K+ concentration, [K+]o, with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 3.7 mM [K+]o.

However, estimated IC(50) values range over two to three orders of concentration, and it is unclear whether this reflects a high selectivity by one or both of the <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamines</span> for particular K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. The purpose of the present study was to determine the concentration-dependent actions of <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> and D600 on three defined <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> K(+) currents. <span class=\"species\">Guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes in the conventional whole-cell configuration were bathed with normal Tyrode's or K(+)-free solution, and pulsed from -80 mV for measurement of the effects of 0.01 microM to 3 mM <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> and D600 on the inwardly-rectifying K(+) current (I:(Kl)) and the two delayed-rectifier K(+) currents, rapidly-activating I:(Kr) and slowly-activating I:(Ks). The <span class=\"chemicals\">phenylalkylamines</span> inhibited both inward- and outward-directed I:(Kl). The IC(50) values for outward I:(Kl) were approximately 220 microM. <span class=\"chemicals\">Verapamil</span> and D600 were approximately equipotent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> of the delayed-rectifier K(+) currents. They inhibited I:(Kr) with IC(50) near 3 microM, and I:(Ks) with IC(50) > or =280 microM. These results are discussed in relation to previous findings on K(+) currents and to the clinical actions of the drugs.</td>\n",

In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle, BRL-32872 did not change resting membrane potential and maximum rate of depolarization but prolonged action potential duration (APD) by 24% +/- 2% at 1.0 microM. When the concentration was increased to 3.0 and 10.0 microM, the effect on APD was not further enhanced, and a bell-shaped dose-response curve resulted. <span class=\"assays\">Patch-clamp</span> experiments in isolated myocytes showed that BRL-32872 inhibited the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 0.028 microM) and the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 2.8 microM) but had a limited effect on the inward rectifier potassium current. In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles stimulated at 300, 500, 1000 and 2000 msec, the effect of BRL-32872 in prolonging APD did not vary (P = .717). By contrast, N-(4-(1-[2-(6-methyl-2-pyridyl)ethyl]-4-piperidyl)- carbonyl]phenyl)methanesulfonamide dihydrochloride dihydrate (<span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span>), a pure class III <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> agent, increased APD more at slower than at faster stimulation rates (P = .001), which illustrated the reverse frequency-dependence of this agent. Among the 35 experiments performed with BRL-32872, only one fiber showed early afterdepolarizations (EADs), and these, which occurred at 1.0 microM, were suppressed at higher concentration (3.0 microM). Moreover, EADs induced by <span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span> were suppressed by BRL-32872 (3.0 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>\n",

The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">SR33557</span> on ICa was dependent on the holding potential (Vh). The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values were estimated to be 2.2 x 10(-8) M at Vh = -50 mV and 9.0 x 10(-6) M at Vh = -80 mV. <span class=\"chemicals\">SR33557</span> (10(-7) M) shifted the steady state inactivation curve of ICa toward more negative potentials. Thus, the <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> of the drug for inactivated <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> was considerably higher than for resting <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. 4. <span class=\"other_terms\">Blockade</span> of ICa by <span class=\"chemicals\">SR33557</span> was both <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span> and <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span>. 5. The time constant of onset of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was 36.4 s at -50 mV and 41.9 +/- 11.1 s at -40 mV. 6. The time course of unblock was <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span>. The time constant declined from 400.7 +/- 68.1 is at -50 mV to 5.2 +/- 1.2 s at -80 mV. 7. The rate of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of ICa was related to the number of openings per unit time and to the amount of time spent depolarized. The <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> of drug for open <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> was considered to be similar to that for inactivated <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. 8. These results suggest that <span class=\"chemicals\">SR33557</span> inhibits <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current through <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to both open and inactivated <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes.</td>\n",

In particular, Ca(V)3.2 (or alpha1H) was cloned from a <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> library, its message was found abundantly in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> tissue, and expressed Ca(V)3.2 was shown to conduct low voltage-activated currents, which inactivate rapidly and are sensitive to Ni2+ and <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span>. These observations suggested that Ca(V)3.2 might encode native <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> but more information on the pharmacology of Ca(V)3.2 was needed to confirm this hypothesis. In the present study, we compare the pharmacology of Ca(V)3.2 expressed in HEK293 cells and of native T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes (\"native-T\"). (1) Ca(V)3.2 and native-T are insensitive to TTX and to toxins selective for N-, P-, or Q-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> (omega-CTx-GVIA, omega-Aga-IVA, omega-CTx-MVIIC). (2) The half-maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> on Ca(V)3.2 is near that on native-T and the <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> is similarly <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span>. (3) Ca(V)3.2 is five- to sixfold less sensitive than native-T to the 1,4-<span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> (DHP) <span class=\"chemicals\">amlodipine</span>, suggesting a difference in the DHP <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site. (4) Both <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> display similar (but not identical) sensitivities to the inorganic <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> Ni2+ and Cd2+ and the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50s</span> are in the range of values found for T-type Ca2+ currents in other cell types. (5) Ni2+ shifts the voltage dependence of Ca(V)3.2 activation but not that of native-T. The many similarities between the two <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> support the contention that Ca(V)3.2 encodes <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>. The slight differences may be due to species variations and/or to the choice of splice variant.</td>\n",

Myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dissociation, and ICa was measured using the whole-cell configuration of the <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> technique modified to permit intracellular perfusion of various substances. Intracellular perfusion with forskolin (0.1 to 10 microM) had a negligible effect on ICa: ICa was increased 15 +/- 13% (mean +/- SE; N = 5). In contrast, superfusion of the cell with forskolin increased ICa significantly. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for the forskolin effect was 0.4 microM. A maximal 4.5-fold increase in ICa occurred with 3 microM forskolin. This is somewhat less than the maximal response to isoprenaline seen in this same series of experiments. The effects of forskolin, isoprenaline, and intracellular cAMP were not additive. In contrast, the effects of isoprenaline or intracellular cAMP and <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> agonists, such as Sandoz (+)202-791, were additive. This supports the hypothesis that the positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effects of forskolin are at least partly mediated by an increase in intracellular cAMP and a stimulation of ICa. The effects of forskolin were antagonized by acetylcholine (1 microM) or intracellular perfusion with cGMP. Acetylcholine on the average decreased forskolin-stimulated ICa 57 +/- 11% (N = 17). The relevance of these results to the suggestion that acetylcholine acts by mechanisms other than inhibition of adenylate cyclase is discussed.</td>\n",

In this study we analyzed the effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin acid (SVA) on the currents responsible for the duration of the plateau of <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> action potentials: hKv1.5, Kv4.3, and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) (I(Ca,L)). hKv1.5 and Kv4.3 currents were recorded in transfected Ltk(-) and Chinese hamster ovary cells, respectively, and I(Ca,L) in <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, using whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span>. Atorvastatin and SVA produced a concentration-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of hKv1.5 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> (IC(50)=4.5+/-1.7 microM and 5.7+/-0.03 microM, respectively) and shifted the midpoint of the activation and inactivation curves to more negative potentials. Importantly, atorvastatin- and SVA-induced <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was added to that produced by <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span>, a drug that <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> hKv1.5 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> by <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to their pore cavity. Atorvastatin and SVA <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> Kv4.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)=13.9+/-3.6 nM and 7.0+/-0.8 microM, respectively). Both drugs accelerated the inactivation kinetics and shifted the inactivation curve to more negative potentials. SVA (10 nM), but not atorvastatin, also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(Ca,L) producing a frequency-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> that, at 2 Hz, reached a 50.2+/-1.5%. As a consequence of these effects, at nanomolar concentrations, atorvastatin lengthened, whereas SVA shortened, the duration of <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> action potentials. The results suggest that atorvastatin and SVA alter Kv1.5 and Kv4.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity following a complex mechanism that does not imply the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of the drug to the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> pore.</td>\n",

It was found that Gd3+ <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> 70% of the IK tail current at a concentration of 100 microM. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> was 24 microM. Action potential durations were, however, reduced, consistent with a predominant effect on depolarizing <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (Ica.L). In the presence of 5 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> Gd3+ prolonged the action potential. Using carbon fibres to stretch cells we observed that 10 microM Gd3+ was not effective in reducing a large stretch-activated increase in resting <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span>. Modelling studies using the OXSOFT <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">HEART</span> program suggest that this lack of response is influenced by <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of repolarizing current but is best reproduced by additional <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of Ca2+ extrusion via the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-Ca2+ exchanger. When Gd3+ is used as a <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of stretch-activated <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> its actions upon both Ica.L and IK must therefore be accounted for.</td>\n",

ET-1 (10(-8) M) had a biphasic effect on I(Ca) (direct effect), causing a transient decrease that was followed by a long-lasting increase which is much smaller than the increase induced by isoprenaline (ISO). The effect of ET-1 on I(Ca) was abolished by a selective ET(A) receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, FR139317 (10(-6) M). The increase in I(Ca) induced by ET-1 (10(-8) M) was enhanced by a selective ET(B) receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, BQ-788 (10(-6) M), as the transient decrease but not the increase in I(Ca) induced by ET-1 (10(-8) M) was suppressed by BQ-788. In the presence of ISO (10(-6) M), ET-1 elicited a more pronounced <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect: at 10(-9)-10(-7) M ET-1 inhibited the ISO-induced increase in I(Ca) in a concentration-dependent manner (anti-adrenergic effect). The maximum inhibition induced by ET-1 at 10(-7) M was approximately 80% of the ISO-induced response, and the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value for anti-adrenergic effect of ET-1 was 4.2x10(-9) M. The anti-adrenergic effect of ET-1 (10(-8) M) was antagonized by the ET(A) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> FR139317 (10(-9)-10(-6) M) in a concentration-dependent manner and was partially inhibited by the ET(B) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> BQ-788 (10(-6) M). The anti-adrenergic effect of ET-1 was markedly attenuated by pretreatment of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes with pertussis toxin. The increases in I(Ca) induced by forskolin (10(-6) M), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (10(-4) M), and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (3x10(-4) M) were also suppressed by ET-1 (10(-8) M). In summary, ET-1 has a differential effect on I(Ca) in the absence and in the presence of ISO: ET- I has a feeble biphasic action on the baseline I(Ca) and, in addition, it elicits a pronounced anti-adrenergic effect on the ISO-induced increase in I(Ca). Pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein is responsible for the anti-adrenergic effect of ET-1 on I(Ca), but the anti-adrenergic effect of ET-1 may involve also the regulation at the level of signaling process beyond the cyclic AMP generation. Anti-adrenergic effect of ET-1 on I(Ca) is mainly due to activation of ET(A) receptors but ET(B) receptors are also involved partially in the anti-adrenergic effect of ET-1 on I(Ca) in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes.</td>\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological effects of ivabradine on the pulmonary vein (PV) <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques and the indo-1 fluorimetric ratio technique were used to investigate the characteristics of the I(f) and intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> (Ca(2+)(i)) in single isolated <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> PV <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> with pacemaker activity before and after an ivabradine administration (0.3, 3, 10, and 30 μM). Ivabradine (0.3, 3, 10, and 30 μM) concentration dependently decreased the spontaneous activity by 6 ± 3%, 32 ± 6%, 49 ± 5%, and 85 ± 4%, and decreased the I(f) by 35 ± 8%, 47 ± 9%, 62 ± 5%, and 65 ± 7%, respectively, in PV <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. The decreased extent of the PV beating rate or I(f) by the different concentrations of ivabradine correlated well with the baseline PV beating rates. The IC(50) of the spontaneous activity and I(f) induced by ivabradine were 9.5 and 3.5 μM, respectively. Moreover, ivabradine (30 μM, but not 3 μM) decreased the Ca(2+)(i) transient in the PV <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> and ivabradine (30 μM) decreased the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current in the PV <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. CONCLUSION: Ivabradine decreased the I(f)s and Ca(2+)(i) transient in the PV <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, which may contribute to its <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on the PV spontaneous activity.</td>\n",

Although composite functions of ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> contribute to the shaping of action potentials, information on the effects of azole antifungal agents on ion currents, except <span class=\"species\">human</span>-ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) K+ currents, is largely lacking. Using the whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique, we investigated the effects of four azole agents (miconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole) on inward rectifying K+ currents (IKir), voltage-gated <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ currents (ICaL), and delayed rectifier K+ currents (IKdr) in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> neonate <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Strikingly, miconazole and ketoconazole strongly inhibited IKir, IKdr, and ICaL at clinically relevant concentrations. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of miconazole for IKdr, IKir, and ICaL inhibition were 2.5, 10.4, and 3.0 µM, respectively. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of ketoconazole for IKdr, IKir and ICaL inhibition were 3.2, 20.8, and 3.5 µM, respectively. Fluconazole and itraconazole had relatively little effect on ion currents. These findings indicate that miconazole and ketoconazole are multiple ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. We suggest that it is necessary to consider this inhibition of ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> by azole agents when assessing <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> side effects.</td>\n",

By use of <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques, the effects of SD-3212, a novel <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> drug, on the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (Ica), the <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> current (INa) and the muscarinic acetylcholine-receptor-operated potassium current (IK.ACh) were examined and compared with those of <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells. 2. SD-3212 inhibited ICa and INa in a concentration-dependent manner. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of SD-3212 for inhibition of ICa and INa were 1.29 microM and 3.92 microM, respectively. The steady state inactivation curves of ICa and INa were shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction in the presence of 1 microM SD-3212. Similar inhibition of ICa and INa was also observed with <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span>. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> for depression of ICa and INa were 1.55 microM and 4.43 microM, respectively. 3. The muscarinic acetylcholine-receptor-operated potassium current (IK.ACh) was activated by the extracellular application of 1 microM carbachol in the GTP-loaded cells or by the intracellular loading of GTP gamma S, a nonhydrolysable GTP <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span>. SD-3212 potently inhibited the carbachol- and GTP gamma S-induced IK.ACh and the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values were 0.38 microM and 0.20 microM, respectively. These <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values were very close and about 10 times lower than those for inhibiting ICa and INa. <span class=\"chemicals\">Bepridil</span> also suppressed the carbachol- and GTP gamma S-induced IK.ACh with the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of 0.69 microM and 0.84 microM, respectively. 4. In <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells stimulated at 0.2 Hz, carbachol at a concentration of 1 microM markedly shortened action potential duration. Both SD-3212 (0.1-1 microM) and <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> (1-10 microM) reversed the action potential shortening in a concentration-dependent manner. The antagonizing effect of SD-3212 on the carbachol-induced action potential shortening was more potent than that of <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span>. 5. These results suggest that SD-3212 inhibits IK.ACh by depressing the function of the potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> itself and/or associated GTP-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> proteins. SD-3212 is a unique <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> drug, which potently inhibits IK.Ach in addition to its class I and IV effects. SD-3212 and <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> may be useful for the termination and prevention of vagally-induced <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> flutter and fibrillation.</td>\n",

Myocytes were held at -70 mV and internally dialyzed and externally perfused with <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)- and K(+)-free solutions; exposure to <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> (10(-9) to 5 x 10(-6) mol/L) resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of peak <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> with a half-maximum inhibition concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of 142 nmol/L. The <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span>-induced inhibition of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> was not mediated via effects on histamine H1 receptors, because 1 mumol/L triprolidine, a more selective and potent H1 <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, had no effect on <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>. In this study, we found that <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> (1) increased both the fast and slow time constants of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> inactivation, (2) shifted the steady state inactivation of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> to more negative potentials, and (3) elicited a <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> and a <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>. The <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span>-induced <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span> and <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> and the steady state inhibition of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> were <span class=\"effect\">voltage dependent</span>. Both <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span> and <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> by <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> at -40 mV were greater than that at -70 mV, and <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> were partially released by applying a long hyperpolarizing prepulse to -90 mV. These results suggest that <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> binds to <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> in inactivated and rested states and inhibits <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> predominantly by interacting with the inactivated state with an apparent dissociation constant of 60 nmol/L. Open-state <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> could be observed only at high concentrations of <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span>. The high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> interaction of <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> with the inactivated state of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> may play an important role in its <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiotoxicity</span> under pathophysiological conditions, such as ischemia.</td>\n",

Patch- and <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> methods were used to measure <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>. <span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">amlodipine</span> were studied for comparison. Samotiadil could be shown to inhibit <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> in a dose-dependent manner in concentrations similar to those of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> but was less effective than <span class=\"chemicals\">amlodipine</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">amlodipine</span> was in the range between 0.1 and 1 microM and that of semotiadil and <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> was between 10 and 100 microM. Recovery from inactivation of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> in the control and under the influence of <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> 0.01 microM) and <span class=\"chemicals\">amlodipine</span> (0.1 microM) was complete alter I. Semotiadil (0.1 microM) and <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> (1 microM) prolonged the time to full recovery to 20 s. This significant delay in the recovery of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> produced by semotiadil indicates a mode of action similar to that of the <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> type of <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> and masses a clear distinction between it and the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridines</span>, which have no effect on the recovery process. The rate dependence of the effect in combination with a distinct influence of the holding potential underlines the use dependence of the mechanism underlying the effect of semotiadil. The well-known high vasoselectivity of semotiadil in combination with a relatively low <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> influence on the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> makes semotiadil an interesting candidate for the treatment of coronary <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> diseases.</td>\n",

The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for MAPK activation by noradrenaline was 2-4 microM and that for isoprenaline was 0.2-0.3 microM. Maximal activation of MAPK by isoprenaline was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">propranolol</span>, whereas the activation by noradrenaline was inhibited by the alpha1-adrenergic <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, prazosin. FPLC on a Mono-Q column separated two peaks of MAPK (p42MAPK and p44MAPK) and two peaks of MAPK-activating activity (MEK) activated by isoprenaline or noradrenaline. Prolonged phorbol ester exposure partially down-regulated the activation of MAPK by noradrenaline but not by isoprenaline. This implies a role for protein kinase C in MAPK activation by noradrenaline but not isoprenaline. A role for cyclic AMP in activation of the MAPK pathway was eliminated when other agonists that elevate cyclic AMP in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocyte did not activate MAPK. In contrast, MAPK was activated by exposure to ionomycin, Bay K8644 or thapsigargin that elevate intracellular Ca2+. Furthermore, depletion of extracellular Ca2+ concentrations with bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-NNN'N'-tetra-acetic acid (BAPTA) or <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> with nifepidine or <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> inhibited the response to isoprenaline without inhibiting the responses to noradrenaline. We conclude that alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists can activate the MEK/MAPK pathway in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> by different signalling pathways. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ rather than cyclic AMP appears important in the activation of MAPK by isoprenaline in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocyte.</td>\n",

The beta-2 adrenergic agonist zinterol increased ICa in a concentration-dependent manner with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> (i.e., the concentration of zinterol at which the response was 50% of the maximum) of 2.2 nM. The effect of zinterol was essentially independent of the membrane potential. The stimulatory effect of zinterol was competitively antagonized by ICI 118,551, a beta-2 adrenergic <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>. The maximal stimulatory effect of zinterol was comparable in amplitude to the effect of a saturating concentration (1 or 10 microM) of isoprenaline, a nonselective beta adrenergic agonist. Moreover, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 microM), a nonselective phosphodiesterase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, or forskolin (10 microM), a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, had no additive effects in the presence of 0.1 microM zinterol. Zinterol had a long lasting action on frog ICa because after washout of the drug, ICa returned to basal level with a time constant of 17 min. An application of acetylcholine (1 microM) during this recovery phase promptly reduced ICa back to its basal level suggesting a persistent activation of adenylyl cyclase due to a slow dissociation rate constant of zinterol from its receptor. Zinterol also increased ICa in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> and <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes, and the maximal effect was obtained at 10 and 1 microM, respectively. In all three preparations, intracellular perfusion with 20 microM PKI(15-22), a highly selective peptide <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, completely antagonized the stimulatory effect of zinterol on ICa. We conclude that beta-2 adrenergic receptor activation produces a strong increase in ICa in frog, <span class=\"species\">rat</span> and <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes which is due to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and activation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation.</td>\n",

We identified the ethacrynic-acid derivative DCPIB as a potent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of I(Cl,swell), which <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> native I(Cl,swell) of calf bovine pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells with an IC(50) of 4.1 microM. Similarly, 10 microM DCPIB almost completely inhibited the swelling-induced chloride conductance in Xenopus oocytes and in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. <span class=\"other_terms\">Block</span> of I(Cl,swell) by DCPIB was fully reversible and voltage independent. 2. DCPIB (10 microM) showed selectivity for I(Cl,swell) and had no significant <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on I(Cl,Ca) in CPAE cells, on chloride currents elicited by several members of the CLC-chloride <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> family or on the <span class=\"species\">human</span> cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR) after heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. DCPIB (10 microM) also showed no significant inhibition of several native anion and cation currents of <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> like I(Cl,PKA), I(Kr), I(Ks), I(K1), I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) and I(Ca). 3. In all <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> (n=7), osmotic swelling produced an increase in chloride current and a strong shortening of the action potential duration (APD). Both swelling-induced chloride conductance and AP shortening were inhibited by treatment of swollen cells with DCPIB (10 microM). In agreement with the selectivity for I(Cl,swell), DCPIB did not affect <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> APD under isoosmotic conditions. 4. Preincubation of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> with DCPIB (10 microM) completely prevented both the swelling-induced chloride currents and the AP shortening but not the hypotonic cell swelling. 5. We conclude that swelling-induced AP shortening in isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells is mainly caused by activation of I(Cl,swell). DCPIB therefore is a valuable pharmacological tool to study the role of I(Cl,swell) in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> excitability under pathophysiological conditions leading to cell swelling.</td>\n",

In the present study, the effect of DPC on fast <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> and slow <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> in freshly isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes was investigated. Currents were recorded (at 25 degrees C) in whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span>. The fast <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ current (INa(f)) was recorded in Ca(2+)-, K(+)-free solutions (external and pipette), with depolarizing pulses applied from -80 mV to -20 mV. The <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (ICa(L)) was recorded in <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-, K(+)-free (external) and Ca(2+)-, K(+)-free (pipette) solutions, with depolarizing steps applied from -40 mV (holding potential) to +10 mV. Perfusion with different concentrations of DPC (from 0.01 to 10 mM) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the INa(f) and ICa(L) currents in a dose-dependent manner. The concentrations of DPC producing half-maximum inhibition (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) were 0.18 mM and 0.47 mM, respectively, for INa(f) and ICa(L). The effect of DPC on INa(f) occurred rapidly, namely within 1 min after addition of the drug and was completed within 3 min. The effect of DPC on ICa(L) had a similar time-course, the maximal steady-state effect being reached by 4-7 min. The effect of DPC was rapidly and completely reversible upon washout. In conclusion, DPC inhibits <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ and Ca2+ currents in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, and is equally potent, or even more potent, than that reported for Cl- <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> or other DPC-sensitive <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.</td>\n",

Published studies show that the relevant physiology and pharmacology exist but does not show the translation between stem cell <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocyte</span> assays and other preclinical safety screening assays, which is crucial for drug discovery and safety scientists and the regulators. Our studies are the first to show the pharmacology of ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> and compare them with existing functional <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiology</span> studies. Ten <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> (a mixture of pure hERG [<span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">Cisapride</span>], hERG and <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> [Flecainide, Mexiletine, <span class=\"chemicals\">Quinidine</span>, and <span class=\"chemicals\">Terfenadine</span>], <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> [<span class=\"chemicals\">Nifedipine</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">Verapamil</span>], and two proprietary <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> [GSK A and B]) were tested, and results from hiPSC-CMs studied on multielectrode arrays (MEA) were compared with other preclincial models and clinical drug concentrations and effects using integrated risk assessment plots. All ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> produced (1) functional effects on repolarization and depolarization around the IC25 and <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values and (2) excessive <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of hERG and/or <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> current precipitated <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>. Our MEA data show that hiPSC-CMs demonstrate relevant pharmacology and show excellent correlations to current functional <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> studies. Based on these results, MEA assays using iPSC-CMs offer a reliable, cost effective, and surrogate to preclinical in vitro testing, in addition to the 3Rs (refine, reduce, and replace animals in research) benefit. </td>\n",

Threshold and <span class=\"IC50s\">ED50</span> values for enhanced contractile force at a pacing frequency of 0.5 Hz are less than 1 microM and 2.2 microM for delta-HCH and 40 microM and 63 microM for gamma-HCH, respectively. Contracture developed in atria exposed to greater than 4 microM delta-HCH (<span class=\"IC50s\">ED50</span> = 11 microM) but not in atria exposed to gamma-HCH. Uptake and release of Ca++ measured from actively loaded <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles is measured with antipyrylazo III. Although delta-HCH (30 microM) decreases Ca(++)-dependent ATPase by 20%, it does not significantly alter Ca++ loading in the presence of ruthenium red. Addition of delta-HCH (5-50 microM) after loading is complete causes rapid, dose-dependent release of Ca++ from SR. Ca++ release induced by delta-HCH is markedly stereoselective. Compared with gamma-HCH (50 microM), delta-HCH (50 microM) induces a nearly 20-fold higher initial rate of Ca++ release (4.3 nmol of Ca++/mg/sec). Studies with [3H]ryanodine demonstrate that delta-HCH sharply inhibits Ca(++)- or daunorubicin-activated radioligand <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 37 and 25 microM, respectively, logit slope = 2). Inhibition of [3H]ryanodine-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> by delta-HCH is stereoselective inasmuch as <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values for alpha, beta and gamma isomers are greater than 100 microM. The delta-HCH modified <span class=\"calcium\">Ca++ channel</span> appears to proceed by a noncompetitive mechanism (reducing Bmax in equilibrium experiments) with respect to the conformationally sensitive <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site for [3H]ryanodine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>\n",

In this study, pharmacological <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of hERG K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> current (I(hERG)) by a novel investigative serotonin-selective reuptake <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> (SSRI), CONA-437, was investigated. Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> measurements of I(hERG) were made from <span class=\"species\">human</span> embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of the hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. With a step-ramp voltage-command, peak I(hERG) was inhibited with an IC(50) of 1.34 μM at 35 ±1°C; the IC(50) with the same protocol was not significantly different at room temperature. Voltage-command waveform selection had only a modest effect on the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of I(hERG) <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>: the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> with a <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> action potential command was 0.72 μM. I(hERG) <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> developed rapidly with time following membrane depolarisation and showed a weak dependence on voltage, accompanied by a shift of ≈ -5 mV in voltage-dependence of activation. There was no significant effect of CONA-437 on voltage-dependence of I(hERG) inactivation, though at some voltages an apparent acceleration of the time-course of inactivation was observed. Significantly, mutation of the S6 aromatic amino acid residues Y652 and F656 had only a modest effect on I(hERG) <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> by CONA-437 (a 3-4 fold shift in <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span>). CONA-437 at up to 30 μM had no significant effect on either Nav1.5 <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> or <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. In conclusion, the novel SSRI CONA-437 is particularly notable as a gating-dependent hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> for which neither S6 aromatic amino-acid constituent of the canonical drug <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site on the hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> appears obligatory for I(hERG) inhibition to occur.</td>\n",

Since the mechanism of the negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect is unknown, we performed a variety of preclinical and mechanistic studies to explore the pharmacological profile of ITZ and understand the negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> mechanism. ITZ was evaluated in: (1) an isolated <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> (IRH) preparation using Langendorff retrograde perfusion; (2) ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> studies; (3) a <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> mitochondrial function profiling screen; (4) a mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assay; (5) in vitro pharmacology profiling assays (148 receptors, ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, transporters, and enzymes); and (6) a kinase selectivity panel (451 kinases). In the IRH, ITZ decreased <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> contractility (>30%) at 0.3μM, with increasing effect at higher concentrations, which indicated a direct negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect upon the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. It also decreased <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate and coronary flow (≥1μM) and prolonged PR/QRS intervals (3μM). In mechanistic studies, ITZ inhibited the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> NaV <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>: 4.2μM) and was devoid of any functional <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect at the remaining pharmacological <span class=\"calcium\">targets</span>. Lastly, ITZ did not affect MMP, nor interfere with mitochondrial enzymes or processes involved with fuel substrate utilization or energy formation. Overall, the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> and mechanistic data suggest that ITZ-induced negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span> is a direct effect on the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>, in addition, the potential involvement of mitochondria function and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> are eliminated. The exact mechanism underlying the negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span> is uncertain, and requires further study.</td>\n",

We investigated the effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> on the two components of the delayed rectifier K(+) current, i.e., the rapidly activating (I(Kr)) and the slowly activating (I(Ks)) currents using tight-seal whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, under <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current with <span class=\"chemicals\">nitrendipine</span> (5 microM) or D600 (1 microM). 2. <span class=\"chemicals\">Bepridil</span> decreased I(Ks) under <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of I(Kr) with E4031 (5 microM), in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration-dependent inhibition of I(Ks) by <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> was fitted by a curve, assuming one-to-one interactions between the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> and the drug <span class=\"chem\">molecule</span>. The concentration of half-maximal inhibition (IC(50)) was found to be 6.2 microM. 3. The effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> on I(Kr) was assessed using an envelope-of-tails test. In the control condition, a ratio of the tail current to the time-dependent current measured during depolarization was large (>1) at shorter pulses (<200 ms), and it decreased to a steady state value of approximately 0.4 with increases in the pulse duration. <span class=\"chemicals\">Bepridil</span> at a concentration of 2 microM did not decrease this ratio at shorter pulses. 4. In a short-pulse (duration=50 ms) experiment that largely activates I(Kr), the drug was found to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> I(Kr) in a cooperative manner (Hill coefficient=3.03) and the IC(50) was 13.2 microM. 5. These results suggest that <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> at a clinical therapeutic concentration ( approximately 2 microM) selectively <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> I(Ks) but does not inhibit I(Kr). This may relate to the characteristic frequency-dependent effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> on the action potential duration (APD), e.g., the non-reverse <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> prolongation of APD.</td>\n",

Although the chromanol derivative chromanol 293B has been shown to be relatively selective in <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> I(Ks) in some species, its selectivity is far from established. METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study uses whole-cell, <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique to examine the selectivity of this <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> for inhibition of I(Ks) in comparison with other repolarizing ionic currents, such as I(Kr), inward rectifier potassium current (I(Kl)), transient outward current (I(to)), and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (I(Ca-L)) in canine left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> mid-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> and endocardial cells. Chromanol 293B <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(Ks) with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 1.8 microM and I(to) with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 38 microM. Concentrations as high as 30 microM did not affect I(Kl), I(Kr), or I(Ca-L). Higher concentrations of chromanol 293B (100 microM) caused a slight, but statistically insignificant, inhibition of I(Kr). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that chromanol 293B is a relatively selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of I(Ks) in canine left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes.</td>\n",

Under control conditions, <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span> (50 micromol/L) did not activate the latent cAMP-regulated Cl- current (ICl). However, in the presence of a subthreshold concentration (1 nmol/L) of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (Iso), <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span> caused a near-maximal activation of this current. In the absence of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>, Iso activated ICl with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 5 nmol/L. In the presence of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>, Iso activated ICl with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 0.3 nmol/L. This facilitatory effect was not observed in the presence of daidzein (50 micromol/L), an <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span> of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span> that only weakly inhibits tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, peroxovanadate, a potent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity, inhibited ICl activated by Iso alone, and it <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the stimulatory effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span> in the presence of Iso. To determine whether the stimulatory effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span> was specific for ICl, we also studied its action on the cAMP-regulated delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (ICa-L) present in these cells. Basal IK and ICa-L were partially (approximately 30% to 40%) inhibited by <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>. However, this <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect was mimicked by daidzein, suggesting that inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity is not involved. In addition to the nonspecific <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect, <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span> also caused a significant increase in the beta-adrenergic sensitivity of the unblocked cationic currents. In the absence of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>, 1 nmol/L Iso had no effect on either IK or ICa-L. However, in the presence of <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>, 1 nmol/L Iso significantly increased the magnitude of both currents. These results suggest that tyrosine kinase activity may play an important role in regulating beta-adrenergic responsiveness of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>.</td>\n",

Both <span class=\"chemicals\">barnidipine</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> reduced I(Ca(L)) in a concentration and <span class=\"effect\">voltage dependent</span> manner; the EC(50) were 80 and 130 nM at a holding potential of -80 mV, respectively, and 18 and 6 nM at -40 mV, respectively. Both drugs induced a leftward shift of the steady-state inactivation curve of I(Ca(L)). Using a twin pulse protocol, the relationships between the amount of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(Ca(L)) by either drug, seen during the second pulse, and the length of the first pulse were described by monoexponential functions reflecting onset of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, dependent on drug concentration. The onset of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> by <span class=\"chemicals\">barnidipine</span> was three times faster than that by <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>. With both drugs, recovery of I(Ca(L)) was 50 times slower than under control conditions and described by monoexponential functions reflecting offset of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> (independent of drug concentration). The offset of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> with <span class=\"chemicals\">barnidipine</span> was three times slower than that with <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>. The time constants of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> and unblock of I(Ca(L)) by both drugs were used to calculate <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> and unbinding and to predict their effects at two frequencies. It is suggested that <span class=\"chemicals\">barnidipine</span> exhibits a higher <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> to the inactivated <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>state as compared to <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>.</td>\n",

Recently, hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA(2)) was found to be a receptor for a ketone body, β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), and is coupled with Gi-GTP <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> protein. HCA(2) expression was reported in the <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. Therefore, using <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes, we investigated effects of BHB on <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current pre-augmented with β-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol under the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span>. BHB significantly reduced the Ca(2+) current pre-augmented with isoproterenol. The effect of BHB was concentration dependent with IC(50) of 1.1 mM. Nicotinic acid (<span class=\"sodium\">NA</span>), another <span class=\"chem\">ligand</span> for HCA(2), also exerted an effect on the Ca(2+) current similar to that of BHB. The effects of BHB and <span class=\"sodium\">NA</span> were reduced by a specific Gi <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, pertussis toxin in the pipette solution. Our results suggest that BHB activates Gi-coupled signal transduction pathway via HCA(2) in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes. The HCA(2)-mediated signal transduction may be associated with ketoacidosis-induced <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> suppression.</td>\n",

Using the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, we investigated the <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects of the substances isolated from the root extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza, which is known as 'Danshen' in Asian traditional medicine. By the intensive activity-guided fractionation, we identified dimethyl lithospermate B (dmLSB) as the most active component, while LSB, which is the major component of the extract, showed negligible <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effect. Action potential duration (APD(90)) was increased by 20 microM dmLSB from 58.8 +/- 12.1 to 202.3 +/- 9.5 ms. In spite of the prolonged APD, no early after-depolarization (EAD) was observed. dmLSB had no noticeable effect on K(+) or Ca(2+) currents, but selectively affected <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) currents (I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>)). dmLSB slowed the inactivation kinetics of I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) by increasing the proportion of slowly inactivating component without inducing any persistent I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>). The relative amplitude of slow component compared to the peak fast I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) was increased dose dependently by dmLSB (EC(50) = 20 microM). Voltage dependence of inactivation was not affected by dmLSB, while voltage dependence of activation shifted by 5 mV to the depolarised direction. Since the APD prolongation by dmLSB did not provoke EAD, which is thought as a possible mechanism for the proarrhythmia seen in other <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> agonists, dmLSB might be an excellent candidate for a <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> agonist.</td>\n",

In the present work, the effects of the <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> drug, berberine, on action potential and ionic currents of cat <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes were studied. 2. Berberine prolonged action potential duration in cat <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes without altering other variables of the action potential. 3. The drug at concentrations of 0.3-30 microM <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> only the delayed rectifier (IK) current with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 4.1 microM. Berberine produced a <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> and a <span class=\"effect\">phasic</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> that was increased with the duration of the depolarizing pulse. The <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effect on IK was <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span>, but not frequency-dependent. 4. In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> preparations two delayed rectifier currents have been found: a rapid (IKr) current and a slow (IKs) current. In the present work it has been found that berberine at the concentrations used, selectively <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> IKr. 5. At concentrations higher than 10 microM it also decreased the transient outward (Ito1) current. The drug did not have effects on the inward rectifier (IK1) or the high threshold <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (Ica-L). 6. These results show that berberine is a specific potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>. The increase in action potential duration induced by berberine can be explained mainly by its <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effects on IK.</td>\n",

Application of 10, 30, 100 and 300 microM sematilide caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the delayed rectifier K+ current (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> approx. 25 microM). The sematilide-sensitive current, which was recorded by means of a triangular voltage command, showed a strong inward rectification and had a peak at about -40 mV, suggesting that sematilide inhibits the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current. The Ca2+-independent transient K+ and the inward rectifier K+ currents were not affected significantly by application of 100 microM sematilide. Moreover, <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ and Ca2+ currents were not affected significantly by 100 microM sematilide. These findings indicate that sematilide selectively <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes and provide evidence supporting the usefulness of the drug as a class III <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> agent.</td>\n",

Application of cromakalim decreased APD at 90% repolarization (APD90) and Ca2+ transient elicited at 0.5 Hz (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50s</span>=0.6 and 3 microM, respectively). Application of 0.3 microM E4031 increased these parameters by 110% and 45%, respectively. Under <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span>, the relation between the duration of depolarization to 0 mV and Ca2+ transients could be described by the sum of two exponential components; the time constants were approximately 5 and 280 msec, respectively. The first component was abolished by 10 microM ryanodine, suggesting the involvement of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). Neither cromakalim nor E4031 directly affected Ca2+ current and Ca2+ transients under <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span>. When APD was changed by K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">modulators</span>, the relation between APD90 and Ca2+-transients was almost similar to that obtained by changing the depolarization duration under <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span>. CICR was changed significantly only when APD90 was markedly shortened by cromakalim. The extensively prolonged AP and Ca2+ transient in the presence of E4031 were reduced by an addition of cromakalim. It is concluded that these two K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">modulators</span> can significantly alter the AP-induced Ca2+ transient mainly by changing APD, which regulates both Ca2+ influx and extrusion.</td>\n",

Both FO and L858051 increased ICa, with half-times of 160 +/- 20 sec and 343 +/- 22 sec, respectively. The stimulation was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by internal perfusion with <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> of protein kinase A. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for stimulation of ICa was 0.3 microM for FO and 1.0 microM for L858051. The maximal stimulated current was the same for both drugs, 20.3 microA/cm2 and 23.1 microA/cm2, respectively. Internal perfusion with 30-500 microM guanylyl 5'-imidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p] suppressed ICa stimulation by low concentrations of FO or L858051. This suppression was due to a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve, with increases in the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values to 11.4 microM for FO and 28.4 microM for L858051. Isoproterenol (ISO) was ineffective in increasing ICa after the FO-stimulated ICa had been reduced by Gpp(NH)p and FO had been washed out. In contrast, after the L858051-stimulated current had been reduced by Gpp(NH)p, ISO stimulated ICa significantly. This stimulation was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> of protein kinase A and was due to a positive effect of L858051 not shared by FO. A brief application of L858051 after Gpp(NH)p had <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the ISO response restored the ISO response for at least 30 min. This effect was mimicked by internal perfusion with low concentrations of L858051. We conclude that the ability of brief exposure of L858051, but not FO, to restore the response to ISO after Gpp(NH)p is due to the accumulation of L858051 intracellularly, due to its hydrophilicity. Because internal L858051 and FO are very ineffective in stimulating adenylyl cyclase, whereas internal L858051 can restore the ISO response <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by Gpp(NH)p, we propose that FO <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> can affect adenylyl cyclase at two sites, one site that is accessible only from the extracellular side that stimulates catalytic activity and another that is accessible from the intracellular side that increases beta-agonist efficacy in the presence of Gpp(NH)p.</td>\n",

METHODS: The effect of EAcF on the contractility was studied using <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> left atria mounted in a tissue bath (Tyrode's solution, 29°C, 95% CO2 , 5% O2 ) and electrically stimulated (1 Hz). Concentration-response curves of EAcF were obtained in the presence of <span class=\"chemicals\">propranolol</span> (1 μm), <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> (1 μm) and in reserpinized animals (5 mg/kg). The involvement of <span class=\"calcium\">l-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> ) on the EAcF effect was observed in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> of mice assessed using <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. KEY FINDINGS: EAcF (550 μg/ml) had a positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect, increasing the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> force by 164% (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>  = 157 ± 44 μg/ml, n = 6), but it was less potent than isoproterenol (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>  = 0.0036 ± 0.0019 μg/ml, n = 8). The response evoked by EAcF was abolished by <span class=\"chemicals\">propranolol</span> or <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>. Reserpine did not alter the <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> response of EAcF. Furthermore, an enhancement of the <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> peak (31.2%) with EAcF was observed. <span class=\"chem\">Chemical</span> analysis of EAcF revealed the presence of at least 10 different flavonoid glycoside derivatives. Two were identified as vicenin II and isorhoifolin. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that EAcF increases the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> contractile force by increasing the <span class=\"calcium\">l-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current and activating the adrenergic receptor pathway.</td>\n",

Whole-cell recordings were made from <span class=\"species\">rat</span> and <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Clomiphene inhibited the volume-regulated chloride current [I(Cl,vol), activated by cell swelling after hypotonic shock (approximately 145 mOsM)] with an IC(50) value of approximately 9.4 microM. In contrast, at concentrations up to 100 microM, clomiphene failed to inhibit both the chloride current activated by cyclic AMP (I(Cl,cAMP)) and the anionic background current (I(AB)). At 10 microM, clomiphene <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the voltage-gated fast <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> current and the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (I(Ca,L)) in both species. The voltage-independent fractional <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(Ca,L) induced by clomiphene (10 microM) was approximately 82%, this concentration also inhibited the inwardly rectifying K(+) current with a fractional current <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of approximately 26% at -90 mV. Fractional <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of outward current at +70 mV in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> was approximately 25%, implying that delayed rectifying K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were also affected by clomiphene. We conclude that clomiphene shows selectivity for I(Cl,vol) over I(Cl,cAMP) and I(AB) and therefore represents a useful tool for studying chloride conductances in isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes with interfering currents <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span>. However, due to its effects on cation conductances it would be of little value in this regard for other types of in vitro or in vivo experiments.</td>\n",

The modulation of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"effect\">voltage-sensitive</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes by <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> was examined by the whole cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> technique. 2. <span class=\"chemicals\">Propafenone</span>, 10(-7) -5 x 10(-5) M, produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> (ICa) without any significant change in the current-voltage relation. Half-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> for the peak ICa at +10 mV was 5 x 10(-6) M. 3. The voltage-dependence of ICa inactivation was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction in the presence of 5 x 10(-6) M <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span>. 4. A frequency-dependent relative <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> by <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> was observed after repetitive depolarizing test pulses at a frequency of 0.5 and 1 Hz. The recovery of ICa from inactivation was prolonged by <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> and the reactivation exhibited an additional exponential component attributed to the slow release from drug <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channels</span>. 5. These results suggest that <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span>, at therapeutic concentrations exhibits <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> properties that may be involved in its <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> mechanism.</td>\n",

Therefore, physiologically relevant screening methods for <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">modulators</span> are required. A 45Ca2+ uptake assay based on clonal <span class=\"species\">rat</span> pituitary cell line GH4C1, possessing <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> VOCCs, was miniaturised into a 96-well plate format. The assay was validated by known <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">nimodipine</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values 3.4 and 0.007 microM, respectively) and by a set of natural <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> and their synthetic derivatives. The results were consistent with our previous data and demonstrated the reliability of the assay. The signal-to-background ratio was 3.9 +/- 0.4, signal-to-noise ratio 10.3 +/- 2.3, Z' factor 0.59 +/- 0.10, and day-to-day variability in positive control values 5%. Furthermore, experiments were also made on a Biomek FX workstation to evaluate the suitability of the assay for automation. With minor modifications the assay is applicable, e.g. for studying possible <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> activators in detail. The established 96-well plate assay modification for screening of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">modulators</span> reduces considerably the time, labour and resources needed for cell culture and experiments, and has significant advantages in terms of automation suitability and overall cost-efficiency.</td>\n",

The goals of the present study were to confirm these findings in vitro in isolated perfused <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hearts as well as in vivo in conscious rats and to compare Ro 40-5967 to <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>. The effects of Ro 40-5967 and <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> were tested not only in normal rats, but also in rats with <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> failure induced by chronic <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> infarction. In isolated Langendorff hearts (without <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> failure), no decrease of contractility was observed with Ro 40-5967 up to complete AV <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>. In contrast, <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> decreased contractility with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 100 nM. In isolated, electrically stimulated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles, the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values for the decrease of contractile force were 15,000 and 440 nM for Ro 40-5967 and <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>, respectively. In vivo, Ro 40-5967 did not decrease left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> contractility (as assessed by changes of dP/dt max +) in rats without and with <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> failure. In contrast, <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> was markedly negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> in both conditions.</td>\n",

Total suppression of phosphorylation by depleting the cell of ATP with a cocktail of beta, gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMP-PCP) 2-deoxyglucose and carboxylcyanide-M-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) did not inhibit the increase in ICa in the Mg2+-deficient medium. Thus, the involvement of phosphorylation process in the increase in ICa was not likely. Effective suppression of this enhancement of ICa was achieved by the application of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). From the dose-response curve for GTP, the GTP concentration required for half-maximal inhibition (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) was estimated to be 4.0 microM at pMg 6. This GTP-induced suppression of ICa is not due to the guanine nucleotide <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> protein (G-protein) cascade, because both activators and <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> of G-protein, which are structural <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> of GTP, suppressed ICa similarly. Treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) did not affect the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> action of Mg2+ and GTP on ICa. GTP is therefore assumed to bind directly to the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span>. Interaction of Mg2+ and GTP with the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> activated in the Mg2+-deficient medium was examined by comparing the dose/response curves for GTP at two different [Mg2+]. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for GTP suppression was estimated to be 5.7 microM at pMg 6 and 6.9 microM at pMg 5. The results suggest strongly that Mg2+ and GTP independently bind and control <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>.</td>\n",

As suggested by previous studies, ACh inhibited the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current at concentrations (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 8 nM) significantly lower than those required for the activation of IK(ACh) (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 101 nM). The pharmacological profiles of the two responses suggest that despite the differences in agonist sensitivity, both are mediated by the same (m2) type of muscarinic receptors. Intracellular application of GDP beta S, an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of G protein function, completely abolished both responses, implying that both actions of ACh are coupled to effectors by G proteins. In contrast, intracellular application of pertussis toxin (PTX) shifted to higher concentrations (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 170 nM) but did not abolish inhibition of the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current by ACh even though the <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of the IK(ACh) response was complete. Increasingly large PTX concentrations and/or prolonged PTX treatments revealed a limiting, PTX-resistant <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> component that appears to be mediated by a PTX-insensitive G protein distinct from that mediating IK(ACh). For the PTX-sensitive components, the different agonist dependencies of IK(ACh) activation and <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current inhibition may imply that different G proteins mediate each response although alternate possibilities involving the same G protein either functionally sequestered and/or differentially affected by interactions with effectors, can not be ruled out.</td>\n",

The present study investigated whether the natural flavone acacetin from the traditional Chinese medicine Xuelianhua would be an <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>-selective anti-AF agent. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of acacetin on <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> ultrarapid delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kur)) and other <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ionic currents were studied with a whole-cell patch technique. Acacetin suppressed I(Kur) and the transient outward K(+) current (IC(50) 3.2 and 9.2 mumol/L, respectively) and prolonged action potential duration in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. The <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the acetylcholine-activated K(+) current; however, it had no effect on the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) current, <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current, or inward-rectifier K(+) current in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes. Although acacetin caused a weak reduction in the hERG and hKCNQ1/hKCNE1 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> stably expressed in HEK 293 cells, it did not prolong the corrected <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> hearts. In anesthetized dogs, acacetin (5 mg/kg) prolonged the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> effective refractory period in both the right and left atria 1 to 4 hours after intraduodenal administration without prolongation of the corrected <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval, whereas <span class=\"chemicals\">sotalol</span> at 5 mg/kg prolonged both the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> effective refractory period and the corrected <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval. Acacetin prevented AF induction at doses of 2.5 mg/kg (50%), 5 mg/kg (85.7%), and 10 mg/kg (85.7%). <span class=\"chemicals\">Sotalol</span> 5 mg/kg also prevented AF induction (60%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that the natural <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> acacetin is an <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>-selective agent that prolongs the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> effective refractory period without prolonging the corrected <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval and effectively prevents AF in anesthetized dogs after intraduodenal administration. These results indicate that oral acacetin is a promising <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>-selective agent for the treatment of AF.</td>\n",

Extracellular lidocaine inhibited I(K) with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 1.9 mM, comparable to 2.6 mM for I(Ba) but 10 times higher than the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) (0.17 mM). Low concentrations of lidocaine (30-100 microM), which had no direct effect on basal I(K), attenuated both the stimulatory and <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> modulation of K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Both modulations had an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> approximately 40 microM independent of [TRH]. Intracellular QX314 (100 microM), a quaternary, charged form of lidocaine, also significantly attenuated the TRH effects; however, external QX314 and the neutral LA benzocaine (100 microM) did not. Lidocaine (</=100 microM) inhibited the TRH-induced increase in [Ca++] but failed to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> either the GTP-gamma-S-induced increase in I(K), the activation of I(K) by directly elevated [Ca++] (ca. 3 x 10(-7) M), or the phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate-induced inhibition of Ca++-activated I(K). Agonist <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> assays revealed that none of the these LAs affected TRH receptor <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>. Similar to its effect on TRH modulation of I(K), lidocaine (100 microM) attenuated the inhibition of <span class=\"calcium\">Ca++ channels</span> in GH3 cells by somatostatin (1 microM). These results suggest that lidocaine's action occurs between agonist <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> and G protein activation. Such inhibition of G protein pathways may be an important component of the general action of LAs acting at spinal sites, or for i.v. therapeutics or during <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiotoxic</span> episodes.</td>\n",

Myocytes in the conventional whole-cell configuration were bathed in normal Tyrode's solution or K+-free Tyrode's solution for the measurement of the effects of 0.01-100 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">nisoldipine</span> on rapidly activating delayed-rectifier K+ current (I(Kr)), slowly activating delayed-rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)), inwardly rectifying K+ current (I(K1)), and reference <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (I(Ca,L)). <span class=\"chemicals\">Nisoldipine</span> inhibited I(Kr) with an IC(50) of 23 microM, and I(Ks) with an IC(50) of 40 microM. The drug also had weak <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on inward- and outward-directed I(K1); the IC(50) determined for outward-directed current was 80 microM. Investigation of <span class=\"chemicals\">nisoldipine</span> action on I(Ks) showed that inhibition occurred in the absence of previous pulsing, and with little change in the time courses of activation and deactivation. However, the drug-induced inhibition was significantly weaker at >or =+30 mV than at +10 mV.5 We estimate that <span class=\"chemicals\">nisoldipine</span> is about 30 times less selective for delayed-rectifier K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> than for <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> in fully polarised <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, and several orders less selective in partially depolarised myocytes.</td>\n",

AP prolongation was observed in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> myocytes at low doses, with plateau elevation and a reduction in the AP overshoot at higher doses. RSD1235 showed selectivity for voltage-gated K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of 13 microM on hKv1.5 (1 Hz) versus 38 and 30 microM on Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, respectively, and 21 microM on hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. RSD1235 did not <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> IK1 (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> > 1 mM) nor <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>= 220 microM) at 1 Hz in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes (n = 4-5). The drug displayed mild (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>= 43 microM at 1 Hz) open-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of Nav1.5 with rapid recovery kinetics after rate reduction (10-->1 Hz, 75% recovery with tau= 320 msec). Nav1.5 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> increased with stimulus frequency from an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>= 40 microM at 0.25 Hz, to an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>= 9 microM at 20 Hz, and with depolarization increasing from 107 microM at -120 mV to 31 microM at -60 mV (1 Hz). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that RSD1235's clinical selectivity and AF conversion efficacy result from <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> combined with frequency- and <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of INa.</td>\n",

In order to examine the mechanism of this protection, we investigated the effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span> on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Extracellular application of <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span> significantly inhibited I(Ca,L) in a <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span>- and <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> manner. The inhibition was also concentration-dependent with an IC(50) of 5.2 microM. Neither the activation nor the steady-state inactivation of I(Ca,L) was altered by <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span>. The <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span>-induced inhibition of I(Ca,L) was reversible after washout of the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>. Addition of 1 microM AA partially reversed the <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span>-induced inhibition of I(Ca,L). Intracellular dialysis, with 2 mM cAMP, significantly increased I(Ca, L), but did not prevent the <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span>-induced inhibition of I(Ca,L). In addition, extracellular application of isoproterenol or membrane permeable db-cAMP did not reverse the <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span>-induced inhibition of I(Ca,L). Biochemical measurement revealed that incubation of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes with <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span> significantly reduced intracellular cAMP levels. The <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span>-induced reduction of cAMP production was abolished by addition of AA. Our results demonstrate that <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span> strongly inhibits <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> I(Ca,L). While <span class=\"chemicals\">mepacrine</span> is a phospholipase A(2) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> and reduces cAMP production, its <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on I(Ca,L) mainly results from a direct <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>.

The cloned <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> was expressed in either Xenopus laevis oocytes or <span class=\"species\">human</span> embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293, stable transfectants). The threshold for Pb++ <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was 1 nM, and the apparent <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value was 152 nM in oocytes and 169 nM in HEK 293 cells. Pb++ <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was dependent on the composition of the external recording solution but not dependent on the subunit composition of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. Pb++ <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was <span class=\"effect\">voltage dependent</span>, with little <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> observed at negative test potentials using low concentrations of Pb++. Strong depolarizations (>+100 mV) reversed Pb++ <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, allowing measurement of reblock kinetics. Reblock was fast (tau = 11 msec), as measured during a +20-mV test pulse. Simple washout did not completely reverse Pb++ <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, especially after exposure to concentrations of >100 nM. Full recovery could only be observed after treatment with heavy metal antidotes such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid and EDTA. These results suggest that Pb++ <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> <span class=\"calcium\">voltage-gated Ca</span>++ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> by two mechanisms and that full reversal of lead <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> requires chelator treatment.</td>\n",

We also evaluated the effects of aprindine on experimental AF in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> hearts. Aprindine (3 microM) inhibited the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) with little influence on the inward rectifier K+ current (IK1) or the Ca2+ current. <span class=\"assays\">Electrophysiological</span> analyses including the envelope of tails test revealed that aprindine preferentially inhibits IKr (rapidly activating component) but not IKs (slowly activating component). The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-operated K+ current (IK.ACh) was activated by the extracellular application of carbachol (1 microM) or by the intracellular loading of GTPgammaS. Aprindine inhibited the carbachol- and GTPgammaS-induced IK.ACh with the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of 0.4 and 2.5 microM, respectively. In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells stimulated at 0.2 Hz, aprindine (3 microM) per se prolonged the action potential duration (APD) by 50+/-4%. The drug also reversed the carbachol-induced action potential shortening in a concentration-dependent manner. In isolated hearts, perfusion of carbachol (1 microM) shortened monophasic action potential (MAP) and effective refractory period (ERP), and lowered <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> fibrillation threshold. Addition of aprindine (3 microM) inhibited the induction of AF by prolonging MAP and ERP. We conclude the efficacy of aprindine against AF may be at least in part explained by its <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on IKr and IK.ACh.</td>\n",

METHOD: Using the whole-cell configuration of the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique, we investigated the stimulation of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> by insulin in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. RESULTS: The stimulation of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> by insulin was dose-dependent (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 33 nM) and reversible. Maximum stimulation of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> over basal <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> was 86 +/- 11% (n = 25) at 1 microM insulin. Insulin (1 microM) shifted the current-voltage relationship and potential-dependent availability of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> to more negative potentials by about 3.5 and 1.5 mV, respectively. The maximum conductance of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> was increased by 1 microM insulin, from 26 +/- 4 to 39 +/- 5 nS (n = 11). Isoproterenol (100 nM), which stimulated <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> by 156 +/- 23% (n = 10) over basal <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>, acted faster than insulin. The half-maximum stimulation of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> by isoproterenol and insulin was reached after 44 +/- 5 and 80 +/- 9 s, respectively. Insulin and isoproterenol responses were not additive. Insulin (1 microM) and isoproterenol (100 nM) stimulation of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> was inhibited by Rp-cAMPS (1 mM) to 12 +/- 3 and 32 +/- 4%, respectively. Insulin (1 microM) increased cAMP content in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> by about two-fold. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; 5 microM) increased <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> by only 5.9 +/- 0.9% (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that insulin stimulates the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes in a dose-dependent and reversible manner and suggest that this effect is mediated by insulin receptors and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase.</td>\n",

The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> and facilitating effects of celecoxib on ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> occur at low micromolar concentrations, bordering on therapeutic concentrations achievable in the clinical setting. The experiments described here were performed with the goals (1) to increase the range of ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> tested, and (2) to examine possible differences in celecoxib's effects on <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> from different species. FINDINGS: The <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> examined in this study using <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> and intracellular recording methods were <span class=\"species\">human</span> KV1.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> expressed in CHO cells, <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> (<span class=\"calcium\">LTCC</span>) from <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, and <span class=\"calcium\">LTCCs</span> from Drosophila larval body-wall muscles. Celecoxib inhibited KV1.3 currents with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 5.0 μM at the end of 200 ms pulses to +20 mV. Celecoxib inhibited peak currents through <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> and Drosophila <span class=\"calcium\">LTCCs</span> with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50s</span> of 10.6 and 76.0 μM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of KV1.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> is associated with suppression of inflammatory immune reactions, the finding that celecoxib can inhibit these <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> raises a question of possible contribution of KV1.3 inhibition to the anti-inflammatory effects of celecoxib. On the other hand, the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>results are consistent with previous observations indicating that, in contrast to K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, strength of celecoxib effects on <span class=\"calcium\">LTCCs</span> strongly varies from species to species.</td>\n",

PKC is therefore a candidate to link receptor <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to I(KATP) activation, but it has not been shown whether and how PKC can activate I(KATP) in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. The present study was designed to determine whether PKC can activate I(KATP) in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> and <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Under conditions designed to minimize <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ and Ca2+ currents, dialysis of <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes with pipette solutions containing reduced [ATP] elicited I(KATP)++, with a 50% effective concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>)of 260 micromol/L. In cells that failed to show I (KATP) under control conditions, superfusion with 1 micromol/L phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (PDD) elicited I(KATP) in a fashion that depended on pipette [ATP], with an [ATP] EC 50 of 601 micromol/L. PDD-induced I(KATP) activation was concentration dependent, with an EC 50 of 7.1 nmol/L. The highly selective PKC <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> bisindolylmaleimide totally prevented I(KATP) activation by PDD, and in blinded experiments, 1 micromol/L PDD elicited I(KATP) in eight of nine cells, whereas its non-PKC-stimulating <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span> 4 alpha-PDD failed to elicit I(KATP) in any of the five cells tested (P = .003). Similar experiments were conducted in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes and showed that 0.1 micromol/L PDD elicited I( KATP) at pipette [ATP] of 100 and 400 micromol/L (five of five cells at each concentration) but not at 1 mmol/L [ATP] (none of five cells). We conclude that PKC activates I(KATP) in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> and <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes by reducing <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> sensitivity to intracellular ATP. This finding has potentially important implications for understanding the mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning.</td>\n",

CCh produced two major effects : (i) in all myocytes, extracellular application of CCh inhibited I(Ca,L) in a reversible concentration-dependent manner; and (ii) in many (but not all) myocytes, upon washout CCh produced a significant transient stimulation of I(Ca,L) ('rebound stimulation'). <span class=\"other_terms\">Inhibitory</span> effects could be observed at 1 x 10(-10) M CCh. The mean steady-state <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration-response relationship was shallow and could be described with a single Hill equation (maximum inhibition = 34.5 %, <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 4 x 10(-8) M, Hill coefficient n = 0.60). Steady-state inhibition (1 or 10 microM CCh) had no significant effect on I(Ca,L) selectivity or macroscopic (i) activation characteristics, (ii) inactivation kinetics, (iii) steady-state inactivation or (iv) kinetics of recovery from inactivation. Maximal inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity (preincubation of myocytes in 1 mM L-NMMA (N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine) + 1 mM L-NNA (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine) for 2-3 h plus inclusion of 1 mM L-NMMA + 1 mM L-NNA in the patch pipette solution) produced no significant attenuation of the CCh-mediated inhibition of I(Ca,L). Protocols involving (i) the nitric oxide (NO) scavenger PTIO (2-phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide; 200 microM), (ii) imposition of a 'cGMP clamp' (100 microM 8-Bromo-cGMP), and (iii) inhibition of soluble guanylyl cyclase (ODQ (1H-[1,2,4,]oxadiazolo(4,3,-a)quinoxalin-1-one), 50 microM) all failed to attenuate CCh-mediated inhibition of I(ca,L). While CCh consistently inhibited basal I(Ca,L) in all RV myocytes studied, not all myocytes displayed rebound stimulation upon CCh washout. However, there was no difference between CCh-mediated inhibition of I(Ca,L) between these two RV myocyte types, and in myocytes displaying rebound stimulation neither ODQ nor 8-Bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP) altered the effect. We conclude that NO production, activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, or changes in intracellular cGMP levels are not obligatorily involved in muscarinic-mediated modulation of basal I(Ca,L) in ferret RV myocytes.</td>\n",

Although the cellular <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> actions of <span class=\"chemicals\">fluoxetine</span> are well characterized in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cells, little is known about the effects of its metabolite. In this study, therefore, the effects of norfluoxetine on action potential (AP) configuration and transmembrane ion currents were studied in isolated canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> using the whole cell configuration of <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> techniques. Micromolar concentrations of norfluoxetine (1-10 microM) modified AP configuration: amplitude and duration of the AP and maximum velocity of depolarization were decreased in addition to depression of the plateau and elimination of the incisura of AP. <span class=\"assays\">Voltage clamp</span> experiments revealed a concentration-dependent suppression of both <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current, I(Ca) (EC(50)=1.13+/-0.08 microM) and transient outward K(+) current, I(to) (EC(50)=1.19+/-0.17 microM) having Hill coefficients close to unity. The midpoint potential of the steady-state inactivation of I(Ca) was shifted from -20.9+/-0.75 mV to -27.7+/-1.35 mV by 3 microM norfluoxetine ( P<0.05, n=7). No such shift in the steady-state inactivation curve was observed in the case of I(to). Similarly, norfluoxetine caused no change in the steady-state current-voltage relationship of the membrane or in the density of the inward rectifier K(+) current, I(K1). All these effects of norfluoxetine developed rapidly and were fully reversible. Comparing present results with those obtained previously with <span class=\"chemicals\">fluoxetine</span>, it can be concluded that norfluoxetine displays stronger suppression of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> than <span class=\"chemicals\">fluoxetine</span>. Consequently, the majority of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> side effects observed during <span class=\"chemicals\">fluoxetine</span> treatment are likely to be attributed to its metabolite norfluoxetine.</td>\n",

The ionic mechanisms underlying these phenomena were investigated in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> isolated hearts and single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes by measuring the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>-to-His bundle (A-H) interval and using <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> recordings, respectively.A decrease in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cycle length from 300 to 190 ms decreased the concentration of adenosine needed to cause atrioventricular nodal <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> from 7.8 +/- 1.0 to 2.6 +/- 0.7 micromol/L (P < 0.001). Ba(2+) (100 micromol/L), a selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of the adenosine-activated inward rectifier K(+) current I(K,ADO) in the atrioventricular node, failed to abolish this rate-dependent effect of adenosine. PD 81,723 (5 micromol/L) potentiated the negative <span class=\"effect\">dromotropic</span> effect of adenosine even after I(K,ADO) was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by Ba(2+) and after attenuation of I(Ca,L) by adenosine was prevented by 8-Br-cAMP (1.5 mmol/L). In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes, adenosine augmented a time- and <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> K(+) current (Ado-I(K)). Ado-I(K) was more sensitive to adenosine than I(K,ADO) (EC(50) values, 0.8 versus 1.4 micromol/L, P < 0.01). PD 81,723 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(K,ADO), but potentiated Ado-I(K). Ado-I(K) was insensitive to Ba(2+) (P = 0.98), whereas it was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by chromanol 293B (5 micromol/L, P < 0.001). Unlike I(K,ADO), Ado-I(K) increased during rapid stimulation of myocytes (P < 0.001). Adenosine augments a time- and <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> K(+) current, Ado-I(K). The pharmacological and kinetic properties of Ado-I(K) are consistent with it playing an important role in the negative <span class=\"effect\">dromotropic</span> effect of adenosine at lower concentrations of the nucleoside, at fast <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rates and in the presence of PD 81,723.</td>\n",

After application of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span>, fKv1.4ΔN inactivation was bi-exponential, with a faster drug-induced inactivation and a slower C-type inactivation. <span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span> increased the C-type inactivation rate and slowed recovery in fKv1.4ΔN <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. However, <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> had no effect on either the slow inactivation time constant or the recovery. CONCLUSION: <span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> accelerate the inactivation of the Kv1.4ΔN <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> by <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to the open state of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. Unlike <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> slows the recovery of the Kv1.4ΔN <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>.</td>\n",

The protein kinase C <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> staurosporine (0.1 mumol/l) and polymyxin B (70 mumol/l) did not antagonize the negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect of PDB. Neither PMA nor PDB, in concentrations up to 30 mumol/l, caused significant changes of the maximum depolarization velocity, the action potential duration or the functional refractory period in intact <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles. In isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> the inward <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current was halved by either 1 mumol/l PDB or 10 mumol/1 PMA. PKC <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> attenuated, but could not completely abolish this effect of the phorboles. It is concluded that the negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect of PDB is caused by a reduction of the slow inward <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current and that this inhibition is, for the greater part, not mediated by an activation of protein kinase C.</td>\n",

The identification of a CFTR-selective <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> would provide an important tool for the investigation of the contribution of CFTR to <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiology</span>. GlyH-101 is a glycine hydrazide that has recently been shown to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> CFTR <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> but its effects on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> are unknown. Here the action of GlyH-101 on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> I(Cl.PKA) and on other ion currents has been established. Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> recordings were made from <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. GlyH-101 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(Cl.PKA) in a concentration- and <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> fashion (IC(50) at +100 mV=0.3 ± 1.5 μM and at -100 mV=5.1 ± 1.3 μM). Woodhull analysis suggested that GlyH-101 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> the open pore of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> CFTR <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> at an electrical distance of 0.15 ± 0.03 from the external membrane surface. A concentration of GlyH-101 maximally effective against I(Cl.PKA) (30 μM) was tested on other <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion currents. Inward current at -120 mV, comprised predominantly of the inward-rectifier background K(+) current, I(K1), was reduced by ∼43% (n=5). Under selective recording conditions, the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) current (I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>)) was markedly inhibited by GlyH-101 over the entire voltage range (with a fractional <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> at -40 mV of ∼82%; n=8). GlyH-101 also produced a <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> inhibition of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>current (I(Ca,L)); fractional <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> at +10 mV of ∼49% and of ∼28% at -10 mV; n=11, with a ∼-3 mV shift in the voltage-dependence of I(Ca,L) activation. Thus, this study demonstrates for the first time that GlyH-101 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> I(Cl.PKA) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in a similar fashion to that reported for recombinant CFTR. However, inhibition of other <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> conductances may limit its use as a CFTR-selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>.</td>\n",

Half inhibition doses (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of <span class=\"chemicals\">benidipine</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> for the peak ICa at +10 mV were 2.7 nM and 63.1 nM, respectively. 2. A change in holding potential from -40 to -75 mV partially removed the <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> induced by both 10 nM <span class=\"chemicals\">benidipine</span> and 100 nM <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>. The <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of ICa by <span class=\"chemicals\">benidipine</span> strongly depended upon holding potentials as did that induced by <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>. 3. The effect of 100 nM <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> was mostly removed when the cells were kept quiescent at holding potentials negative to -75 mV for 5 min after withdrawal of <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>. In contrast, hyperpolarization for several minutes did not significantly accelerate the removal of <span class=\"chemicals\">benidipine</span>-induced <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> after withdrawal of the drug. Effects of 10 nM <span class=\"chemicals\">benidipine</span> could not be washed out for up to 30 min regardless of the holding potentials. 4. It is suggested that the dissociation of <span class=\"chemicals\">benidipine</span> from the DHP <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site, like that of <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>, is greatly accelerated by hyperpolarization. <span class=\"chemicals\">Benidipine</span> but not <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> may have an additional interaction with the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> or lipid membrane and cannot be washed away even after the dissociation. Alternatively, the dissociation of <span class=\"chemicals\">benidipine</span> from the DHP <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site may be too slow to occur substantially during the limited period of hyperpolarization in the present study (less than 30 min).

The chromanol derivate 293B <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> currents expressed by minK and not HERG in Xenopus oocytes, but little is known about its effects on native currents and action potentials. We aimed to establish the effects of 293B on K+, <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ and Ca2+ currents and action potentials in <span class=\"species\">human</span> and <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. METHODS: Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> techniques were applied to assess the effects of 293B on isolated myocytes at 36 degrees C. RESULTS: Delayed rectifier current (IK) elicited by pulses to +60 mV from a holding potential of -50 mV in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> myocytes was strongly inhibited by 293B (maximum inhibition 96.9 +/- 0.8%; 50% <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration, <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>, 1.02 microM), but IK during pulses to -10 mV was unaffected (3.9 +/- 8.4% inhibition at 50 microM). Half-activation voltages, current-voltage relations, and current densities of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive IK correspond to those of IKr and IKs respectively. Inward rectifier K+ current, <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ current and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current were unaffected by 293B. Transient outward current in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes was inhibited by 293B at an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 24 microM, less than one twentieth the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> for IKs inhibition in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> myocytes. While <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span> prolonged action potential duration (APD) with strong reverse use dependence, 293B prolonged <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> and <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> APD to a similar fractional extent at all frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: 293B is a selective IKs <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>, and the frequency dependence of APD prolongation caused by this IKs <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> is different from that caused by IKr <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>: 293B may be an interesting tool to study the physiologic role of IKs and the <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> potential of IKs <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>.</td>\n",

Here we have used isolated <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes to compare the effect of the proarrhythmic antihistaminic drug <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> with the non-proarrhythmic antihistaminic drugs fexofenadine and rupatadine on intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> homeostasis. Perforated <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique was used to measure ionic currents and to detect spontaneous <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Our results show that the <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span>, with known arrhythmogenic effects, inhibits <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (I(Ca)) with an IC(50) of 185 nM when cells are stimulated at 1.0 Hz. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of 0.3 muM <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> increased from 19+/-4% at stimulation frequency of 0.2 Hz to 63+/-6% at 2.0 Hz. Moreover, <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> also increased spontaneous <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. At a concentration of 1 muM, <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> significantly increased the spontaneous <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>-Ca exchange current (I(NCX)) frequency from 0.48+/-0.25 to 1.93+/-0.67 s(-1). In contrast, fexofenadine and rupatadine did not change I(Ca) or the frequency of spontaneous I(NCX). We conclude that the proarrhythmic antihistaminic drug <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span> alters intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> handling in isolated <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether or not the class Ia <span class=\"effect\">anti-arrhythmic</span> agent <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span> modulates ionic current (INaCa) generated by the sarcolemmal <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+-Ca2+ exchanger of adult <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes. 2. Selective whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> recordings of INaCa were made from <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, with major interfering currents <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span>. The INaCa was measured as the ionic current sensitive to 10 mmol/L external Ni2+ during a descending voltage ramp protocol. 3. The effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span> concentrations in the range 10-100 micromol/L were studied. <span class=\"chemicals\">Quinidine</span> produced a concentration-dependent partial <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of outward INaCa, generated by reverse-mode exchange. At +60 mV, 100 micromol/L <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> INaCa by 33.0 +/- 4.1% (mean+/-SEM; n = 4). This was the maximal concentration that we were able to test, because concentrations of <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span> higher than 100 micromol/L were found to be toxic to cells under our conditions. The drug did not produce any significant inhibition of inward INaCa (generated by forward-mode exchange). 4. The Ni2+-insensitive residual current was not significantly altered by <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span> at any membrane potential, confirming that the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span> we observed could be attributed to an action on the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+-Ca2+ exchanger. 5. For the purpose of comparison, <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span> was tested against <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> (<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>). It <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> peak <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> at 0 mV, with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 14.9 +/- 1.5 micromol/L. Thus, <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span> was less potent against the exchanger than against <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>. 6. Our data suggest that <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span> preferentially inhibits the Naout/Cain mode of exchanger function.

Whole-cell currents were recorded from <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes using the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique under conditions designed to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> and electrogenic transporters. 2. Exposure of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes to the hyposmotic external solution (<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ reduction to about 70% of control) resulted in hyposmotic cell swelling which was associated with activation of an outwardly rectifying Cl- current (ICl,swell). 3. Whereas the activation of ICl,swell was not significantly affected by replacement of ATP in the pipette solution with the non-hydrolysable ATP <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span> 5'-adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), its activation was greatly reduced in cells dialysed with an ATP-free pipette solution, thus indicating that the activation process of ICl,swell requires the presence of intracellular ATP, but not its hydrolysis. 4. Bath application of glibenclamide produced a concentration-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of ICl,swell with a half-maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of 60.0 microM and a Hill coefficient of 2.1. The maximal effect (100% inhibition) was obtained with 500 microM glibenclamide. The steady-state inhibition showed little voltage dependence, while glibenclamide at concentrations of more than 100 microM inhibited the outward ICl,swell more rapidly than the inward ICl,swell. The glibenclamide inhibition was fully reversible after removal of the drug, even when a maximal effect (full inhibition) was achieved at a high drug concentration (500 microM). 5. These results show that (i) glibenclamide is one of the most potent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> of <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> ICl,swell, and (ii) <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> ICl,swell and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- currents are almost equally sensitive to inhibition by glibenclamide.</td>\n",

I(Ca,L) was recorded using a whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> configuration in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, and the [Ca2+]i transient was detected by use of Fluo-3 in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. Cells were preincubated with LIF (1000 U/ml) for 15 min before whole cell recording. LIF increased I(Ca,L) by 41.8%. LIF synergistically increased I(Ca,L) with isoproterenol. Preincubation with H89 did not inhibit the LIF-induced increase in I(Ca,L), indicating that this phenomenon is PKA-independent. PD98059 completely inhibited the increase in I(Ca,L), and this effect was dose-dependent (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>=3.6 micromol/l). Other signal transduction <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> including AG490, SB203580, chelerythrine, <span class=\"chemicals\">genistein</span>, and KN62 did not affect the LIF-induced increase in I(Ca,L). Perforated <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> recording revealed that LIF maximally increased the I(Ca,L) by 25% at 15 min. LIF also increased the peak [Ca2+]i transient level by 63% at 15 min. PD98059 fully inhibited the increase in the [Ca2+]i transient. In conclusion, LIF increased I(Ca,L) and the [Ca2+]i transient in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, and the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway might be involved in the modulation of this activation.</td>\n",

This study goal was to further test the hypothesis that urocortin2 may modulate action potentials as well as rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents. With whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques, action potentials and slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents were recorded in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, respectively. And rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents were tested in hERG-HEK293 cells. Urocortin2 produced a time- and concentration-dependent prolongation of action potential duration. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values of action potential duration and action potential duration at 90% of repolarization were 14.73 and 24.3nM respectively. The prolongation of action potential duration of urocortin2 was almost completely or partly abolished by H-89 (protein kinase A <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>) or KB-R7943 (<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)/Ca(2+) exchange <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>) pretreatment respectively. And urocortin2 caused reduction of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents in hERG-HEK293 cells. In addition, urocortin2 slowed the rate of slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activation, and rightward shifted the threshold of slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents to more positive potentials. Urocortin2 prolonged action potential duration via activation of protein kinase A and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)/ Ca(2+) exchange in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes in a time- and concentration- dependent manner. In hERG-HEK293 cells, urocortin2 reduced rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current density which may contribute to action potential duration prolongation.</td>\n",

Under current clamp conditions, pirmenol (2-30 microM) prolonged action potential duration in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting resting membrane potential in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. However, in the presence of 4-aminopyridine (4 mM), pirmenol (10 microM) failed to prolong the action potential duration further. Pirmenol also suppressed acetylcholine-induced hyperpolarization and action potential duration shortening, resulting in a significant prolongation of the action potential duration in the presence of acetylcholine. Under <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> conditions, pirmenol (1-1000 microM) inhibited transient outward current (I(to)) in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration for half-maximal inhibition (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of pirmenol on I(to) was about 18 microM. Pirmenol did not show the use and frequency dependent inhibition of I(to). The voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation of I(to) and the recovery from inactivation were not significantly affected by pirmenol. Pirmenol accelerated the inactivation of I(to) and <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(to) as an exponential function of time, consistent with a time-dependent open <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>. Pirmenol (30 microM) did not affect the inwardly rectifying K+ current significantly, but it decreased the <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current by about 20%. In <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes, both acetylcholine and adenosine induced a specific K+ current activated by GTP-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> proteins. Pirmenol suppressed both the acetylcholine- and adenosine-induced K+ current effectively. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of pirmenol for acetylcholine- and adenosine-induced current was about 1 and 8 microM, respectively. The present results suggest that pirmenol prolongs the action potential duration by primarily inhibiting the transient outward current in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes.

In the present study, we have examined the effects of celikalim on contractility and ionic currents in feline <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> muscle. Celikalim was found to decrease contractility in electrically stimulated (2 Hz frequency) left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> and right <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle preparations with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of 0.95 +/- 0.12 microM (n = 6) and 0.29 +/- 0.07 microM (n = 5), respectively. Glyburide (1 microM) reversed the celikalim-induced negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span> (left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> halves). Celikalim was also shown to activate a glyburide-sensitive current in <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamped</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes that reversed close to the calculated value of the potassium equilibrium potential (n = 4 cells). In addition, celikalim was found to inhibit voltage-activated <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (<span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span>) in isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes (51 +/- 2% inhibition at 1 microM; n = 4 cells). We conclude that celikalim is a potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activator and hypothesize that both the negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span> and the glyburide-sensitive current evoked by this drug are mediated by ATP-regulated potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Inhibition of voltage-activated <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> by celikalim may also contribute to the negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span> induced by this drug.</td>\n",

In contrast, the highest concentration of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> used (10 microM) inhibited the response to high K+ (59 mM for 5 min) by only 25%. 3. 45Ca2+ uptake into cells stimulated with DMPP (100 microM for 1 min) was also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> in a concentration-dependent manner (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 0.4 microM). Again, <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the K(+)-evoked 45Ca2+ uptake (70 mM K+ for 1 min) only by 20%. In contrast, the N-P-Q-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> omega-conotoxin MVIIC depressed the K+ signal by 70%. In the presence of this toxin, <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> exhibited an additional small <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect, indicating that the <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> was acting on <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>. 4. Whole-cell Ba2+ currents through <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> in <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamped</span> chromaffin cells were inhibited by 3-10 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> by 20-25%. The inhibition was readily reversed upon washout of the drug. 5. The whole-cell currents elicited by 100 microM DMPP (IDMPP) were inhibited in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner by <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>. Maximal effects were found at 10 microM, which reduced the peak IDMPP by 70%. The area of each curve represented by total current (QDMPP) was reduced more than the peak current. At 10 microM, the inhibition amounted to 80%; the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for QDMPP inhibition was 0.73 microM, a figure close to the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for 45Ca2+ uptake (0.4 microM) and [3H]-noradrenaline release (1.3 microM). The <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> developed very quickly and did not exhibit use-dependence; thus the drug <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> in its closed state. The <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effects of 1 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> on IDMPP were similar at different holding potentials (inhibition by around 30% at -100, -80 or -50 mV). <span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span> did not affect the current flow through <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. 6. These data are compatible with the idea that <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> has little effect on Ca2+ entry through <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> in bovine chromaffin cells. Neither, does <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> affect INa. Rather, <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> acts directly on the neuronal nicotinic receptor ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> and <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> ion fluxes, cell depolarization and the subsequent Ca2+ entry and catecholamine release. This novel effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> might have clinical relevance since it might reduce the sympathoadrenal drive to the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> and blood vessels, thus contributing to the well established antihypertensive and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> effects of the drug.</td>\n",

In the present study, we examined the frequency dependence of <span class=\"chemicals\">efonidipine</span> action on the T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. The <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of <span class=\"chemicals\">efonidipine</span> to inhibit the T-type Ca2+ current was higher under higher stimulation frequencies. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values were 1.3 x 10(-8), 2.0 x 10(-6) and 6.3 x 10(-6) M under stimulation frequencies of 1, 0.2 and 0.05 Hz, respectively. The reduction of T-type Ca2+ current amplitude was not accompanied by change in the time course of current decay. <span class=\"chemicals\">Efonidipine</span> (10 microM) inhibited T-type Ca2+ current elicited by depolarization from holding potentials ranging from -90 to -30 mV by about 30%; the voltage-dependence of steady-state inactivation was not changed by the drug. <span class=\"chemicals\">Efonidipine</span> slowed the recovery from inactivation following an inactivating prepulse. In conclusion, <span class=\"chemicals\">efonidipine</span> was shown to have frequency-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects on the T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span>, which could be explained by slow dissociation of the drug from the inactivated state of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>.</td>\n",

As a consequence, the manufacturer has restricted the use of budipine in patients who exhibit additional risk factors for the development of \"Torsades-de-Pointes\" <span class=\"effect\">tachycardias</span> (<span class=\"effect\">TdP</span>). The molecular basis of this serious side effect has not been elucidated yet. <span class=\"species\">Human</span> ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> being the main cause of drug induced <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> prolongation, we investigated the effect of budipine on the rapid component of the delayed-rectifier potassium current (I(K(r))) in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> and on HERG potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, budipine (10 microM) inhibited I(K(r)) by 86% but was without any effect on <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents. In Xenopus oocytes, HERG potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by budipine with an IC(50) of 10.2 microM. Onset of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was fast and <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was only slowly and incompletely reversible upon washout. Budipine <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in the open and inactivated state, but not in the closed states. The half-maximal activation voltage was slightly shifted towards more negative potentials. Steady-state inactivation of HERG was also influenced by budipine. Budipine <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was neither voltage- nor frequency-dependent. In HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> mutants Y652A and F656A, drug <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> was reduced dramatically. Therefore, these two aromatic residues in the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> pore are likely to form a main part of the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site for budipine. In summary, this is the first study that provides a molecular basis for the budipine-associated aLQTS observed in clinical practice. Furthermore, these findings underline the importance of the aromatic residues Y652 and F656 in the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of lipophilic drugs to HERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.</td>\n",

Morphine produced a concentration-dependent reduction in peak transient <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> current. When the <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> current (INa) was evoked at 5-s intervals the estimated <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for morphine was approximately 30 mumol litre-1. Morphine 10 mumol litre-1 inhibited INa with a 5-mV shift in the potential-dependent inactivation curve to negative potentials and retarded the INa recovery rate from the inactivated state. <span class=\"effect\">Use-dependent</span> INa <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was not observed when INa was elicited at frequencies varying from 0.2 to 20 Hz. Morphine did not significantly affect the inward <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (ICa), transient outward current (Ito) or the inwardly rectifying potassium current (IK1) at a concentration of 30 mumol litre-1. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of morphine on INa could not be prevented or reversed by treatment with the opioid <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> naloxone. Therefore, we suggest that morphine can directly inhibit the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ inward current and bind to inactivated <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.</td>\n",

The effect of the <span class=\"effect\">bradycardic</span> agent S 16257 on the main ionic mechanisms of diastolic depolarization in sinoatrial node cells isolated from <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>, was investigated by the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique in whole-cell and macro-patch recordings. 2. In whole-cell conditions, S 16257 induced a marked exponential <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of the hyperpolarization-activated I(f) current, without shift of the voltage range of its activation curve. The rate of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> increased with the drug concentration. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for the <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(f) was 2.8 x 10(-6) M. 3. A similar <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> decline of I(f) was obtained with 3 microM S 16257, in cell-attached and in inside out macro-patch configurations, suggesting that the <span class=\"effect\">bradycardic</span> agent interacts with I(f) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> from the inside of the cell. 4. A high concentration of S 16257 (10 microM) had no detectable effect on T-type <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current and slightly decreased <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (-18.12 +/- 0.66%), without significant <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>. 5. S 16257 had no effect on the delayed outward potassium current Ik at 3 microM and slightly decreased it only at high concentrations, -16.3 +/- 1.2% at 10 microM. In contrast, zatebradine, another <span class=\"effect\">bradycardic</span> agent, reduced I k by 20.3 +/- 2.5% at 3 microM. 6. In conclusion, S 16257 may lower <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate without significant negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> action. In comparison with zatebradine, S 16257 had less effect on Ik suggesting less prolongation of repolarization time.</td>\n",

In isolated single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocyte of <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span>, <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> whole cell recording techniques were used to record the current of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> and cytosolic Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]i) labeled with fluorescence probe Fluo-3/AM was measured under a laser scanning confocal microscope. Results revealed that Are (3-100 mumol/L) could inhibit <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current in a concentration-dependent manner and the value of <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> was 33.73 mumol/L (n = 5). In the absence of extracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span>, the resting levels of [Ca2+]i was not affected by Are (n = 6, P > 0.05), but pretreatment with Are (30 mumol/L) could significantly inhibit the [Ca2+]i elevation induced by caffeine (10 mmol/L, n = 6, P < 0.01). It was concluded that Are could inhibit not only <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> influx through <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> but also <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> release from sarcoplasmic reticulum.</td>\n",

The effect of ruthenium red on <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> and <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> currents was studied in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> cells with the whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. 2. Ruthenium red very efficiently <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current in a dose-dependent manner. A significant <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was observed for concentrations as low as 0.3 microM. Analysis of the dose-response curve with the logistic equation indicated an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 0.8 microM, a maximum inhibition of 85% reached at 5 microM, and a coefficient of 2.37. 3. There was no shift in the voltage-dependence of the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> activation, nor in that of its steady-state inactivation determined with a 1 s prepulse. However, removal of <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> inactivation at positive voltage was considerably reduced in the presence of concentrations of ruthenium red above 1 microM. A slowing of the time-course of inactivation of the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> was also observed. 4. At 10 microM, a concentration generally used to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> the sarcoplasmic Ca release <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> or the mitochondrial Ca uptake, ruthenium red <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> 26.7+/-4.3% (n=8) of the <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> current, and slowed its inactivation time-course. No effect was observed on the voltage-dependence of the current activation or inactivation. The peak <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> current was also decreased at a 10 times lower concentration by 7.6+/-2.7% (n=3). 5. Thus, at concentrations used to assess intracellular Ca movements, ruthenium red induced in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> cells a significant <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of both Ca and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.</td>\n",

MLB was found to possess a variety of pharmacological actions. However, it is unclear whether and how MLB affects the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. In the present study, the effects of MLB on the voltage-activated ionic currents were investigated in single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes of adult guinea pigs. MLB reversibly inhibited <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)). The inhibition was <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> and <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> (the IC(50) value of MLB was 30 microM and 393 microM, respectively, at the holding potential of -50 mV and -100 mV). In the presence of 100 microM MLB, both the activation and steady-state inactivation curves of I(Ca,L) were markedly shifted to hyperpolarizing membrane potentials, whereas the time course of recovery of I(Ca,L) from inactivation was not altered. MLB up to 300 microM had no significant effect on the fast-inactivating <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) current (I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>)), delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(K)) and inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)). The results suggest that the <span class=\"calcium\"><span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> Ca</span>(2+) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> effect of MLB work in concert with its antioxidant action for attenuating <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> ischemic injury.</td>\n",

Most cells have been shown to express at least two Ca(2+)-release mechanisms controlled by different messengers, and this can lead to redundancy, convergence, or divergence of responses. One exception appears to be muscle and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> contractile tissues. Here, it is thought that the dominant intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> is the ryanodine receptor, while IP(3) receptors are poorly expressed and their role appears to be negligible. We now report that NAADP receptors are functional and abundant in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> microsomes. NAADP binds specifically and with high <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> (130 pM and 4 nM) to two sites on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> microsomes and releases Ca(2+) with an apparent EC(50) of 323 +/- 14 nM. Furthermore, <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> experiments show that this receptor displays both positive and negative cooperativity, a peculiarity unique among intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span>. Therefore, we show that the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> possesses multiple mechanisms to increase the complexity of Ca(2+) signaling and that NAADP may be integral in the functioning of this organ.</td>\n",

To validate the direct comparison of ACh effects on beta-adrenergic responses, the sensitivity of ICa to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (Iso) was studied in both WT and NOS3-KO <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> myocytes. ICa sensitivity to Iso was not found to be significantly different in WT and NOS3-KO myocytes: Iso increased ICa with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 4.9 and 3.7 nM in WT and NOS3-KO myocytes, respectively. ACh-induced inhibition of ICa did not significantly differ in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes from WT and NOS3-KO mice. ACh (10 microM) inhibited the stimulatory effect of 3 nM Iso by 39 and 35% in WT and NOS3-KO myocytes, respectively. Exposure to and subsequent washout of ACh in the continuous presence of submaximally stimulating concentrations of Iso (1-3 nM) resulted in a transient rebound stimulation of ICa in both WT and NOS3-KO <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> myocytes. The magnitude of the stimulatory effect of ACh did not significantly differ in WT and NOS3-KO mice. These results indicate that nitric oxide (NO) generated by NOS3 does not significantly affect the beta-adrenergic responsiveness of ICa. The results also confirm previous work indicating that NO generated by NOS3 is not obligatory for muscarinic inhibition of the beta-adrenergically regulated ICa in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Finally these results demonstrate for the first time that NO generated by NOS3 is not involved in muscarinic rebound stimulation of ICa in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes.</td>\n",

While avoiding the use of drugs with maximum therapeutic concentrations within 30-fold of their hERG <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration 50% (IC(50)) values has been suggested, there are drugs that are exceptions to this rule: hERG <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> that do not cause <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span>, and drugs that can cause <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> but are not strong hERG <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span>. In this study, we investigate whether a simulated evaluation of multi-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> effects could be used to improve this early prediction of <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected multiple ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> data (hERG, <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>, <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca) on 31 drugs associated with varied risks of <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span>. To integrate the information on multi-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, we have performed simulations with a variety of mathematical models of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cells (for <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span>, <span class=\"species\">dog</span>, and <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocyte models). Drug action is modelled using IC(50) values, and therapeutic drug concentrations to calculate the proportion of <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> and the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> conductances are modified accordingly. Various pacing protocols are simulated, and classification analysis is performed to evaluate the predictive power of the models for <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> risk. We find that simulation of action potential duration prolongation, at therapeutic concentrations, provides improved prediction of the <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> risk associated with a <span class=\"chem\">compound</span>, above that provided by existing markers. CONCLUSION: The suggested calculations improve the reliability of early <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> safety assessments, beyond those based solely on a hERG <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> effect.</td>\n",

We studied the effects of Ang II on I(Ca,L) in single adult <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes using a perforated <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique with gramicidin D. Ang II increased I(Ca,L) in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50)=0.75 nM). In contrast, in conventional whole-cell patch-calmp, <span class=\"calcium\">I(Ca,L)</span>ran down gradually and the I(Ca,L) response to Ang II was variable, suggesting the potential loss of diffusible components crucial for the Ang II-induced signaling process. An AT(1) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, CV11974 (0.1 microM), completely inhibited the increase in I(Ca,L) induced by Ang II (0.1 microM), whereas an AT(2) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, PD123319 (10 microM), did not influence the I(Ca,L) increase. Neither pre- nor after-treatment with a <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/H+ exchange (NHE) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> HOE642 (1 microM) affected the Ang II-induced increase in I(Ca,L). The protein kinase C (PKC) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> chelerythrine (1 microM) did not affect the Ang II-induced I(Ca,L) increase. The present findings indicate that Ang II increases I(Ca,L) via AT(1) receptors in adult <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Neither the activation of NHE nor PKC may contribute to the Ang II-induced activation of I(Ca,L).</td>\n",

HMR 1556 inhibited this current half-maximally at a concentration of 120 nmol/l (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>). Expression of the K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> Herg, Kv 1.5, Kv 1.3 and Kir2.1, and also the cationic current HCN2, were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> little or not at all by 10 micromol/l HMR 1556. In isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes from the <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> method revealed inhibition of the IKs current with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>, of 34 nmol/l. Other current components, like IKr and IK1. were only slightly <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> at an HMR 1556 concentration of 10 micromol/l, whereas 10 micromol/l HMR 1556 inhibited the transient outward current I(to) and the sustained outward current I(sus) in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes by 25% and 36%, respectively. The <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by 10 micromol/l HMR 1556 by 31%. <span class=\"species\">Guinea pig</span> right <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles were investigated by the micropuncture technique at various pacing rates. In the frequency range of 0.5-7 Hz HMR 1556 (1 micromol/l) caused a prolongation of the action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) by 19%-27%. In the presence of isoproterenol (10 micromol/l) the prolongation of the APD90 was more pronounced at low pacing rates (47% at 0.5 Hz and 35% at 1 Hz, compared with 25% at 7 Hz). The monophasic action potential was recorded in Langendorff-perfused <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> hearts. In spontaneously beating preparations, HMR 1556, at 0.1 micromol/l and 1 micromol/l, prolonged the MAPD90 by 3% and 10%, respectively, with no further prolongation at 10 micromol/l. The prolongation was much greater at low pacing rates [25% at 100 beats per min (bpm) and 13% at 150 bpm] than at fast pacing rates (9% at 350 bpm). The left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> pressure LVPmax was not affected at 1 micromol/l HMR 1556, but it decreased by 15% at 10 micromol/l. Other parameters, like the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate and coronary flow, were only slightly decreased at 1 micromol/l HMR 1556. In conclusion, HMR 1556 is a potent and selective <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of the IKs current in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. The prolongation of the action potential duration is maintained at fast pacing rates.</td>\n",

The whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> and intracellular perfusion techniques were used for studying the effects of atropine and other muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents (ICa) in frog and <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, and on the mAChR-activated K+ current (IK(ACh)) in frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. 2. In frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, atropine (0.1 nM to 1 microM) reversed the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of acetylcholine (ACh, 1 nM) on ICa previously stimulated by isoprenaline (Iso, 2 microM), a beta-adrenergic agonist. However, in the concomitant presence of Iso, ACh and atropine, ICa was > 50% larger than in Iso alone. 3. The effects of atropine were then examined in the absence of mAChR agonists. After a preliminary stimulation of ICa with Iso (0.1 or 2 microM), atropine induced a dose-dependent stimulation of ICa. <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> (i.e. the concentration of atropine at which the response was 50% of the maximum) and Emax (i.e. maximal stimulation of ICa expressed as percentage increase in ICa with respect to the level in Iso alone) were respectively 0.6 nM and 35%. The stimulatory effect of atropine on ICa was not <span class=\"effect\">voltage dependent</span>. 4. Atropine (1 microM) had no effect on frog ICa (i) under basal conditions, (ii) upon stimulation of ICa by the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> agonist (-)-Bay K 8644 (1 microM), or (iii) when ICa had been previously stimulated by intracellular perfusion with cyclic AMP (3 microM). However, atropine increased ICa after a stimulation by forskolin (0.3 microM). Therefore, an increased adenylyl cyclase activity was required for atropine to produce its stimulatory effect on ICa. 5. The order of <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of mAChR <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> to reverse the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of ACh on Iso elevated ICa in frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricle</span> was atropine > AF-DX 116 >> pirenzepine. In the absence of ACh, mAChR <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> produced their stimulatory effect on Iso elevated ICa with the same order of <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>. 6. Intracellular substitution of Gpp(NH)p (5'-guanylylimidiphosphate) for GTP (420 microM) induced a strong inhibition of frog ICa in the presence of Iso (2 microM). This effect was attributed earlier to the spontaneous and irreversible activation of the GTP-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> regulatory protein (G protein), Gi, responsible for adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Atropine (1 microM) slowed down by a factor of 2 the rate of ICa inhibition induced by Gpp(NH)p. 7. In frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes, intracellular perfusion with 1 mM Gpp(NH)p induces spontaneous activation of IK(ACh). This effect was attributed earlier to the spontaneous and irreversible activation of the G protein, GK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</td>\n",

Therefore, in the present study we compared the sensitivity to BDM of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> system of the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) <span class=\"species\">rat</span>. While BDM significantly decreased the blood pressure (BP) for both strains, the SHR was significantly more responsive. Specifically, 5, 30, 100, and 200 mg/kg BDM (intravenously) reduced BP of the SHR by 9 +/- 3, 20 +/- 3, 49 +/- 5, and 63 +/- 7 mm Hg, respectively. The same doses of BDM reduced BP of the WKY by 0, 2 +/- 0.4, 18 +/- 3, and 26 +/- 3 mm Hg. The duration of the hypotensive effect of BDM was also greater for the SHR. In vitro, BDM had a greater suppressant effect on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (ICa(L)) of SHR <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes; the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for the suppression of ICa(L) was 17 and 29 mM for SHR and WKY <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, respectively. The beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol antagonized the suppressant effect of BDM on ICa(L). Furthermore, BDM significantly reduced the duration of both spontaneous and electrically stimulated action potentials of cultured neonatal <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. Intracellular dialysis with the catalytic unit of protein kinase A antagonized BDM's effect on the action potential. These data suggest that suppression of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> activity contributes to the hypotensive effect of BDM. In addition, the elevated response to BDM of SHR <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes may indicate that the conformation and/or modulation of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> differ for the SHR and WKY lines of <span class=\"species\">rat</span>.</td>\n",

Screening pharmaceutical <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> for Ca(v)1.2 <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> is very important in developing drugs without <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> liability. Ca(v)1.2 screening has been traditionally done using fluorescence assays, but these assays have some limitations. <span class=\"assays\">Patch clamping</span> is considered the gold standard for ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> studies, but is very labor intensive. The purpose of this study was to develop a robust medium throughput Ca(v)1.2 screening assay in <span class=\"assays\">PatchXpress</span> 7000A by optimizing cell isolation conditions, recording solutions and experimental parameters. Under the conditions established, structurally different standard Ca(v)1.2 <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> and an agonist were tested. METHODS: HEK-293 cells stably transfected with hCa(v)1.2 <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channel</span> were used. For experiments, cells were isolated using 0.05% Trypsin. Currents were recorded in the presence of 30 mM extracellular Ba2+ and low magnesium intracellular recording solution to minimize rundown. Ca(v)1.2 currents were elicited from a holding potential of -60 mV at 0.05 Hz to increase pharmacological sensitivity and minimize rundown. Test <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> were applied at increasing concentrations for 5 min followed by a brief washout. RESULTS: Averaged peak Ca(v)1.2 current amplitudes were increased from 10 pA/pF to 15 pA/pF by shortening cell incubation and trypsin exposure time from 2.5 min at 37 degrees C to 1 min at room temperature and adding 0.2 mM cAMP to the intracellular solution. Rundown was minimized from 2%/min to 0.5%/min by reducing the intracellular free Mg2+ from 2.7 mM to 0.2 mM and adding 100 nM Ca2+. Under the established conditions, we tested 8 structurally different <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> and an agonist. The IC(50) values obtained ranked well against published values and results obtained using traditional clamp experiments performed in parallel using the expressed cell line and native myocytes. DISCUSSION: This assay can be used as a reliable pharmacological screening tool for Ca(v)1.2 <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> to assess <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> for <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> liability during lead optimization.</td>\n",

In this study the whole-cell arrangement of the <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> technique was used to examine the effect of NaI on PKA-stimulated Cl- and <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Cl- currents (ICl) activated either by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or the membrane-soluble cAMP <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span>, 8-chlorphenylthio (8-CPT) cAMP, were greatly reduced in amplitude after substitution of an external solution containing 140 mM NaCl with a solution containing 140 mM NaI. This reduction was accompanied by a shift of -7 mV in the reversal potential (Erev) for ICl and could be reversed upon return to the NaCl external solution. Inhibition of ICl by NaI occurred in a concentration-dependent manner and was more pronounced for inward ICl (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 19 mM at -60 mV) than for outward ICl (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 60 mM at +60 mV). In contrast to ICl activated by PKA, ICl activated by PKC was slightly augmented in the presence of NaI and the Erev was found to shift by -15 mV. Based on these data, the relative permeability of I- to Cl- (PI/PCl) for this <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> was calculated to be 1.79. NaI produced no change in the amplitude of inward <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents (ICa) recorded under basal conditions, but strongly inhibited ICa augmented by isoproterenol and 8-CPT cAMP, and during dialysis of cells with the catalytic subunit of PKA (CS). The in vitro incorporation of [gamma-32P]ATP into histone IIA and Kemptide, measured in the presence of PKA and cAMP, was not significantly different in assay mixtures containing salts of Cl- and I-. However, the ability of isoproterenol to augment basal ICa in whole-cell experiments was attenuated when experiments were carried out entirely in NaI external solution. Thus, the reduction in ICl and ICa observed in this study may result from a direct effect of I- on the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> proteins or associated regulatory proteins.</td>\n",

As FP-induced intracellular acidosis is more severe during the inhibition of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-H(+) exchange (NHE), we examined the possible role of NHE in the regulation of I(Ca) during FP exposure using HOE642 (cariporide), a specific NHE <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>. A flow of pressurized (~16 dyn/cm(2)) fluid was applied onto single <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, and the I(Ca) was monitored using a whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> under HEPES-buffered conditions. In cells pre-exposed to FP, additional treatment with HOE642 dose-dependently suppressed the I(Ca) (IC(50) = 0.97 ± 0.12 μM) without altering current-voltage relationships and inactivation time constants. In contrast, the I(Ca) in control cells was not altered by HOE642. The HOE642 induced a left shift in the steady-state inactivation curve. The suppressive effect of HOE642 on the I(Ca) under FP was not altered by intracellular high Ca(2+) buffering. Replacement of external Cl(-) with aspartate to inhibit the Cl(-)-dependent acid loader eliminated the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of HOE642 on I(Ca). These results suggest that NHE may attenuate FP-induced I(Ca) suppression by preventing intracellular H(+) accumulation in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes and that NHE activity may not be involved in the Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of the I(Ca) during FP exposure.</td>\n",

To test the hypothesis that cGMP acts by stimulating a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, PDE activity and the effects of methylisobutylxanthine (MIX), a PDE <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, on ICa were examined in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> dissociated from frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricle</span>. PDE activity was determined by measuring hydrolysis of [33P]cAMP in subcellular fractions. Using 100 microM cAMP as substrate, approximately 50% of the PDE activity was found in the 20,000 x g particulate fraction. Basal activity in this fraction had a Vmax of 15.4 nmol [corrected] of cAMP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein and a Km of 113 microM cAMP. The PDE activity of the particulate fraction was stimulated significantly by cGMP. Half-maximal stimulation was observed with 1.1 microM cGMP. This value is virtually identical to the value for the concentration of intracellular cGMP that produced a half-maximal reduction of cAMP-elevated ICa in <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> experiments. The cGMP-stimulated PDE activity had a Vmax of 9.5 nmol/min/mg [corrected] and a Km of 12.3 microM cAMP. MIX (100 microM) selectively inhibited the cGMP-stimulated PDE activity (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 20 microM). To determine whether PDEs modulate the amplitude of ICa, the effects of MIX were examined on basal ICa and cAMP-elevated ICa. MIX produced small increases in the basal ICa and increased ICa in the presence of 1 microM intracellular cAMP. MIX at 100 microM potentiated the effects of submaximal doses of isoproterenol and shifted the dose-response curve for cAMP to the left but did not affect the dose-response curve for 8-bromo-cAMP. MIX reversed the effect of cGMP on the cAMP-elevated ICa. We conclude that cyclic nucleotide PDEs play an important role in modulating the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current. The hypothesis that cGMP inhibits the cAMP-elevated ICa by activating a PDE is supported by the finding that MIX inhibited both the cGMP-stimulated PDE activity and the effect of cGMP on ICa at similar concentrations.</td>\n",

Treatment may be accompanied by prolongation of the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval of the electrocardiogram and torsades de pointes <span class=\"effect\">tachycardias</span>. Up to now, it has been thought that therapeutic <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> causing <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> prolongation are associated with direct <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"species\">human</span> ether a-go-go-related gene (hERG), which encodes the alpha subunit of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> I(Kr) currents. We show that pentamidine has no acute effects on currents produced by hERG, KvLQT1/mink, Kv4.3, or SCNA5. <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">Cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents and the <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> action potential were also not affected. After overnight exposure, however, pentamidine reduced hERG currents and inhibited trafficking and maturation of hERG with IC(50) values of 5 to 8 microM similar to therapeutic concentrations. Surface expression determined in a chemiluminescence assay was reduced on exposure to 10, 30, and 100 microM pentamidine by about 30, 40, and 70%, respectively. These effects were specific for hERG since expression of hKv1.5, KvLQT1/minK, and Kv4.3 was not altered. In isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, 10 microM pentamidine prolonged action potential duration APD(90) from 374.3 +/- 57.1 to 893.9 +/- 86.2 ms on overnight incubation. I(Kr) tail current density was reduced from 0.61 +/- 0.09 to 0.39 +/- 0.04 pA/pF. We conclude that pentamidine prolongs the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> action potential by <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of hERG trafficking and reduction of the number of functional hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> at the cell surface. We propose that pentamidine, like arsenic trioxide, produces <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> prolongation and torsades de pointes in patients by inhibition of hERG trafficking.</td>\n",

In <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> experiments with isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes of <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span> caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the Ca2+ current, with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 14 microM. Inhibition of the Ca2+ current by <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span> (2 microM) was dependent upon stimulation frequency, with a greater <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> occurring at 2 Hz (approximately 50%) than at 0.2 Hz (approximately 15%). The magnitude of Ca2+ current <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was also potential-dependent. A markedly greater inhibition by <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span> (20 microM) was recorded when myocytes were depolarized (to +20 mV) from a holding potential of -35 mV than of -80 mV. At the less negative potential, <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span> also caused a reduction in the level of the holding current, which suggests a decrease in the inwardly rectifying K+ current. <span class=\"chemicals\">Cibenzoline</span> also caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of KCl-induced contractures of isolated aortic strips of the <span class=\"species\">rat</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 55 microM) and a reduction in contractile force of isolated, electrically-stimulated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles of the <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 35 microM). Thus, <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span> possesses <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> (class 4) properties in addition to its local anaesthetic actions.</td>\n",

Despite numerous reports on activation of I(KACh) by acetylcholine in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, it has yet to be demonstrated what role this <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> plays in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> conduction. We studied the effect of tertiapin, a bee venom peptide <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> I(KACh), to evaluate the role of I(KACh) in Langendorff preparations challenged with ACh. ACh (0.5 microM) reproducibly and reversibly induced complete atrioventricular (AV) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> in retroperfused <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> isolated hearts (n=12). Tertiapin (10 to 300 nM) dose-dependently and reversibly prevented the AV conduction decrements and the complete <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> in unpaced hearts (n=8, P<0.01). Tertiapin dose-dependently blunted the ACh-induced negative chronotropic response from an ACh-induced decrease in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate of 39+/-16% in control conditions to 3+/-3% after 300 nM tertiapin (P=0.01). These effects were not accompanied by any significant change in <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> intervals. Tertiapin <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(KACh) with an IC(50) of 30+/-4 nM with no significant effect on the major currents classically associated with <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> repolarisation process (I(Kr), I(Ks), I(to1), I:(sus), I(K1) or I(KATP)) or AV conduction (I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) and I(Ca(L))). In summary, tertiapin prevents dose-dependently ACh-induced AV <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> in mammalian hearts by inhibiting I(KACh).</td>\n",

In this study, we determined the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiotoxicity</span> of Mitragynine and other <span class=\"chem\">chemical</span> constituents isolated using <span class=\"species\">human</span> induced pluripotent stem cell-derived <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> (hiPSC-CMs). METHODS AND RESULTS: The rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>) and action potential duration (APD) were measured by whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span>. The expression of KCNH2 and cytotoxicity was determined by real-time PCR and Caspase activity measurements. After significant IKr suppression by Mitragynine (10 µM) was confirmed in hERG-HEK cells, we systematically examined the effects of Mitragynine and other <span class=\"chem\">chemical</span> constituents in hiPSC-CMs. Mitragynine, Paynantheine, Speciogynine and Speciociliatine, dosage-dependently (0.1∼100 µM) suppressed IKr in hiPSC-CMs by 67%∼84% with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> ranged from 0.91 to 2.47 µM. Moreover, Mitragynine (10 µM) significantly prolonged APD at 50 and 90% repolarization (APD50 and APD90) (439.0±11.6 vs. 585.2±45.5 ms and 536.0±22.6 vs. 705.9±46.1 ms, respectively) and induced <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmia</span>, without altering the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current. Neither the expression, and intracellular distribution of KCNH2/Kv11.1, nor the Caspase 3 activity were significantly affected by Mitragynine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that Mitragynine and its <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> may potentiate <span class=\"effect\">Torsade de Pointes</span> through inhibition of IKr in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>.</td>\n",

Little is known, however, about the mechanisms by which these adverse reactions may occur, especially with regard to newer drugs such as <span class=\"chemicals\">fluoxetine</span>. We hypothesized that these side effects may have an <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> basis at the level of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocyte. Thus, we investigated the effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">fluoxetine</span> and other antidepressants on action potentials and ionic currents of <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes using the amphotericin B perforated <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> technique. <span class=\"chemicals\">Fluoxetine</span> (10 microM) prolonged the action potential duration (APD50) to 146.7 +/- 12.9% of control value without altering resting membrane potential. <span class=\"chemicals\">Fluoxetine</span> and sertraline potently inhibited the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 2.82 and 2.31 microM, respectively), but did not significantly modify the steady-state inactivation. <span class=\"chemicals\">Amitriptyline</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">imipramine</span> had similar, but slightly weaker, effects (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 3.75 and 4.05 microM, respectively). <span class=\"chemicals\">Fluoxetine</span> attenuated the peak transient outward K+ current and also altered current kinetics, as shown by accelerated decay. <span class=\"chemicals\">Fluoxetine</span> did not change the voltage-dependence of the steady-state inactivation. Sertraline, <span class=\"chemicals\">amitriptyline</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">imipramine</span> inhibited the transient outward K+ current with <span class=\"chem\">potencies</span> very similar to <span class=\"chemicals\">fluoxetine</span>. In contrast to the other antidepressants tested, trazodone weakly inhibited the Ca2+ and K+ currents and moclobemide had no detectable effect. Our comparative pharmacology data suggest that selective serotonin reuptake <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span>, such as <span class=\"chemicals\">fluoxetine</span>, are as potent as tricyclic antidepressants in inhibiting <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ and transient outward K+ currents.

Gentamicin (10(-4)-10(-2) M) and Co2+ (10(-4)-10(-2) M) produced a decrease in developed tension of canine isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> muscles leading to near abolition at 10(-2) M. Their negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effects developed rapidly and wore off shortly after wash-out. 2. The concentration-negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect curves for gentamicin were shifted to the right in a parallel manner by increasing external Ca2+, or by the presence of Bay K 8644 (10(-7)-10(-5) M) or isoprenaline (10(-7)-10(-5) M). <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values for gentamicin increased about 3-fold with about a 6 fold increase in external Ca2+. The Schild plot yielded a pA2 of 2.29 for Ca2+ and its slope was -1.17 (r = -0.79). 3. The concentration-negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect curves for Co2+ were shifted to the right in a parallel manner by increasing external Ca2+, or by the presence of isoprenaline (10(-7)-10(-5) M). <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values for Co2+ increased about 5 fold with about a 6 fold increase in external Ca2+. The Schild plot gave a pA2 value of 2.60 for Ca2+ and its slope was -1.11 (r = -0.86). 4. The concentration-positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect curves for Ca2+, which were computer-fitted to a logistic equation, gave 2.88 x 10(-3) M for <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>. This value was very close to the KCa calculated from pA2 values for Ca2+ based on <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonism</span> between gentamicin or Co2+ and Ca2+ (5.13 x 10(-3) and 2.51 x 10(-3) M). 5. It is concluded that like Co2+, gentamicin <span class=\"chem\">molecules</span> compete with Ca2+ for the same <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> sites presumably located at the outer orifice of Ca-<span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> sarcolemma.</td>\n",

In <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, low voltage-activated inward current consists of I(CaT) and a tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive I(Ca) component (I(Ca(TTX))). In this study, we reexamined the nature of low-threshold I(Ca) in <span class=\"species\">dog</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>, as well as whether it is affected by <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> toxins. Ca(2+) currents were recorded using the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> technique. In the absence of external <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+), a transient inward current activated near -50 mV, peaked at -30 mV, and reversed around +40 mV (HP = -90 mV). It was unaffected by 30 microM TTX or micromolar concentrations of external <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+), but was inhibited by 50 microM Ni(2+) (by approximately 90%) or 5 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">mibefradil</span> (by approximately 50%), consistent with the reported properties of I(CaT). Addition of 30 microM TTX in the presence of Ni(2+) increased the current approximately fourfold (41% of control), and shifted the dose-response curve of Ni(2+) <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> to the right (IC(50) from 7.6 to 30 microM). Saxitoxin (STX) at 1 microM abolished the current left in 50 microM Ni(2+). In the absence of Ni(2+), STX potently <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(CaT) (EC(50) = 185 nM) and modestly reduced I(CaL) (EC(50) = 1.6 microM). While TTX produced no direct effect on I(CaT) elicited by expression of hCa(V)3.1 and hCa(V)3.2 in HEK-293 cells, it significantly attenuated the <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of this current by Ni(2+) (IC(50) increased to 550 microM Ni(2+) for Ca(V)3.1 and 15 microM Ni(2+) for Ca(V)3.2); in contrast, 30 microM TTX directly inhibited hCa(V)3.3-induced I(CaT) and the addition of 750 microM Ni(2+) to the TTX-containing medium led to greater <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of the current that was not significantly different than that produced by Ni(2+) alone. 1 microM STX directly inhibited Ca(V)3.1-, Ca(V)3.2-, and Ca(V)3.3-mediated I(CaT) but did not enhance the ability of Ni(2+) to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> these currents. These findings provide important new implications for our understanding of structure-function relationships of I(CaT) in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>, and further extend the hypothesis of a parallel evolution of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> from an ancestor with common structural motifs.</td>\n",

Because the alpha(1)-, beta(1,2)-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>, carvedilol, has been shown to be outstandingly beneficial in the treatment of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> failure, its direct effects on intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> ion concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), including <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonism</span> to isoproterenol, in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes were investigated and then compared with a selective beta(1)-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>, atenolol, and a non-selective beta(1,2)-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>, timolol. At 1-300 nmol/L, carvedilol decreased the amplitude of [Ca(2+)] (i) by approximately 20% independently of its concentration, which was a similar effect to timolol. All the beta-<span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> at 10 nmol/L decreased the amount of cAMP, but atenolol had the least effect. Carvedilol in the micromol/L order further diminished the amplitude of [Ca(2+)](i) transients, and at 10 micromol/L increased the voltage threshold for pacing myocytes. These effects were not observed with timolol or atenolol. <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ currents (I(Ca)) were decreased by carvedilol in the micromol/L order in a concentration dependent manner. As for the beta-antagonizing effect, the concentrations of carvedilol, timolol, and atenolol needed to prevent the effect of isoproterenol by 50% (IC(50)) were 1.32, 2.01, and 612 nmol/L, respectively. Furthermore, the antagonizing effect of carvedilol was dramatically sustained even after removal of the drug from the perfusate. Carvedilol exerts negative effects on [Ca(2+)](i), including inhibition of the intrinsic beta-activity, reduction of I(Ca) in the micromol/L order, and an increase in the threshold for pacing at > or =10 micromol/L.

Following a 10-min exposure of cells to 3 microM cocaine, APD90 increased significantly by +22 +/- 5% (n = 6). In contrast, following a ten minute exposure to 30 or 100 microM cocaine, APD90 was reduced by -24 +/- 6% (n = 5) and -53 +/- 2% (n = 8), respectively. The ionic basis for cocaine's effects on the APD was investigated using the whole cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> technique at 37 degrees C. Cocaine produced a concentration-dependent reduction in the amplitude of IK tail currents with an estimated <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 4 microM. The kinetics and voltage dependence of the cocaine-sensitive current indicate that cocaine selectively <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> a current identical to the <span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span> sensitive current IKr. No significant reduction of the slow component of IK (IKs) was observed during exposure to 30 or 100 microM cocaine. High (30 and 100 microM) concentrations of cocaine also produced a significant reduction of both the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current and the TTX-sensitive plateau current. Pre-treatment of cells with 10 microM TTX also converted the APD-shortening effect of 30 microM cocaine to one of APD-prolonging. This implies that cocaine <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of a TTX-sensitive window current contributes to the APD-shortening effects produced by high concentrations of cocaine. We conclude that: (1) cocaine produces a biphasic concentration-dependent effect on repolarization in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes; and (2) this biphasic effect on repolarization results from differences in the sensitivity of inward and outward currents to the <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effects of cocaine.</td>\n",

The regulation of IK and ICa were studied in single cells isolated from bull-frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span> using the whole-cell configuration of the <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> and a perfused patch pipette. 2. IK was increased approximately 50-100% and ICa was increased approximately 6-10 times by 1 microM-isoprenaline, 5 microM-forskolin, or internal perfusion with 30 microM-cyclic AMP. The effects of cyclic AMP and isoprenaline were not additive. The shape of the concentration-response curves and the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values for the effects of cyclic AMP on ICa and on IK were very similar (2.3 microM for IK and 1.7 microM for ICa). 3. Elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP had a similar effect on IK regardless of whether ICa was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> with Cd2+ or not. Increasing ICa with <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> agonists had no effect on IK amplitude. 4. Isoprenaline or cyclic AMP caused an increase in the fully-activated IK and also shifted the activation curves to more negative potentials in most cells. The shift in the activation curve was reversible and was also observed when ICa was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> with Cd2+. The rate of activation of IK was increased and the rate of deactivation of IK was slowed by isoprenaline. 5. After breaking the membrane patch and initiating whole-cell recording, IK ran down with time in about 50% of the cells examined when the intracellular solution contained 1 mM [Mg2+]. In contrast, when the solution contained 0.3 mM [Mg2+], rundown was almost never observed. Internal perfusion with increasing concentrations of [Mg2+] caused reversible decreases in the maximum amplitude of IK and shifted the IK activation curve slightly to more negative potentials, but had negligible effects upon the shape or the curvature of the fully activated current-voltage relationship.</td>\n",

It is unknown whether Qiliqiangxin has an effect on <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> current and K current because the pharmacological actions of this herb's <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> are very complex. We investigated the rational usage of Qiliqiangxin on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes of rats. <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">Ventricular</span> myocytes were exposed acutely to 1, 10, and 50 mg/L Qiliqiangxin, and whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique was used to study the acute effects of Qiliqiangxin on <span class=\"sodium\">Sodium</span> current (I <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>), outward currents delayed rectifier outward K(+) current (I K), slowly activating delayed rectifier outward K(+) current (I Ks), transient outward K(+) current (I to), and inward rectifier K(+) current (I K1). Qiliqiangxin can decrease I <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> by 28.53% ± 5.98%, and its <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> was 9.2 mg/L. 10 and 50 mg/L Qiliqiangxin decreased by 37.2% ± 6.4% and 55.9% ± 5.5% summit current density of I to. 10 and 50 mg/L Qiliqiangxin decreased I Ks by 15.51% ± 4.03% and 21.6% ± 5.6%. Qiliqiangxin represented a multifaceted pharmacological profile. The effects of Qiliqiangxin on <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> and K currents of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes were more profitable in <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> therapy in the clinic. We concluded that the relative efficacy of Qiliqiangxin was another choice for the existing <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> therapy. </td>\n",

Typical of adrenergic terminals, norepinephrine exocytosis was enhanced by activation of prejunctional angiotensin AT1-receptors and attenuated by adrenergic alpha 2-receptors, adenosine A1-receptors, and histamine H3-receptors. Exogenous bradykinin enhanced norepinephrine exocytosis by 7% to 35% (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>, 17 nmol/L), without inhibiting uptake 1. B2-receptor, but not B1-receptor, <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> antagonized this effect. The kininase II/angiotensin-converting enzyme <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> enalaprilat and the addition of kininogen or kallikrein enhanced norepinephrine exocytosis by approximately equal to 6% to 40% (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>, 20 nmol/L) and approximately equal to 25% to 60%, respectively. This potentiation was prevented by serine protease <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> and was antagonized by B2-receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>. Therefore, norepinephrine exocytosis is augmented when bradykinin synthesis is increased or when its breakdown is inhibited. This is the first report of a local kallikrein-kinin system in adrenergic nerve endings capable of generating enough bradykinin to activate B2-receptors in an autocrine/paracrine fashion and thus enhance norepinephrine exocytosis. This amplification process may operate in disease states, such as <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> ischemia, associated with severalfold increases in local kinin concentrations.</td>\n",

To examine further the effect of the drug on <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>-Ca exchange in intact <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cells and the pharmacological specificity of this action, we determined in cultured chick <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> cells the effects of dichlorobenzamil on the following: contractile state, Nai-dependent Ca uptake, Ca uptake via slow <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channels</span> (defined as <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>-inhibitable Ca uptake), Ca efflux via the sarcolemmal Ca pump, monovalent cation transport, and cellular Ca and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> content. Dichlorobenzamil produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the amplitude of cell motion (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 5 X 10(-7) M) and abolished the development of ouabain-induced rhythm disturbances and contracture. In normal or <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>-loaded cells, dichlorobenzamil inhibited the Ca uptake rate, also in a concentration-dependent manner (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 6 X 10(-7) M). Dichlorobenzamil (6 X 10(-7) M) also caused a significant inhibition of the isoproterenol-induced elevation of Ca uptake. At 5 X 10(-5) M, dichlorobenzamil <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> completely Ca influx via slow <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channels</span>. Ca efflux rate was also reduced by dichlorobenzamil (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 10(-6) M). Replacement of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> with choline in the efflux medium to prevent Ca efflux via <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>-Ca exchange did not alter the <span class=\"IC50s\">ED50</span> of the drug's inhibition of Ca efflux rate. Dichlorobenzamil caused concentration-dependent inhibition of <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> pump activity as judged by ouabain-sensitive 42K uptake (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> approximately 2 X 10(-6) M), and, at concentrations above 5 X 10(-7) M), produced an increase in steady state cellular <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> content. These results indicate that dichlorobenzamil has several sites of action in intact <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> cells and that the negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> action of the drug is due, in part, to inhibition of Ca influx via both <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>-Ca exchange and slow <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channels</span>.</td>\n",

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) reduces cell shortening at high concentrations in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. We have studied the effects of the peptide on <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes. 2. We have recorded <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes under conditions in which the effects of other overlapping currents have been minimised by using <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-free, K(+)-free external solution and <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> electrodes containing Cs+. 3. Peak inward <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current is reduced by NPY at concentrations in excess of 1 nM, and maximal inhibition (31%) was found at and above concentrations of 100 nM. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value for NPY inhibition of peak <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current was 1.72 nM. 4. NPY had no effect on the voltage-dependence of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current amplitude, on the time course of current inactivation, or on the voltage-dependence of the steady-state gating variables. 5. NPY did not reduce the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current in the presence of 8-Br-cyclic AMP, and it was also without effect when GTP-gamma-S or GDP-beta-S were included in the patch pipette. 6. We conclude that in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes NPY acts at low concentration to reduce <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current, via a G-protein-mediated pathway and reduction in intracellular cyclic AMP.</td>\n",

The effect of internal perfusion with the hydrolysis-resistant GTP <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span>, GppNHp (5'guanylylimidodiphosphate), on basal ICa and ICa stimulated with forskolin or isoprenaline was examined to gain insight into the role of G proteins in ICa regulation. 2. Without added guanine nucleotides, isoprenaline stimulated ICa approximately 14-fold with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 0.09 microM. Forskolin stimulated ICa approximately 10-fold with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 0.30 microM. 3. Internal 30 microM-GppNHp produced an approximately 80% decrease in ICa elevated by 0.3 microM-isoprenaline or 3 microM-forskolin. The inhibition of isoprenaline stimulation was due to a decrease in the maximal stimulation from approximately 14-fold to approximately 14-fold without a significant change in the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>. In contrast, the reduction in forskolin stimulation was due to a 22-fold increase in the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> to 11.4 microM, with little change in maximal stimulation. 4. The inhibition of stimulated ICa by GppNHp is likely to be mediated by a G protein, because the effects of GppNHp are irreversible, and are <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by excess GTP. ICa is affected similarly by GppNHp and by ACh. This suggests that GppNHp activates the same G protein that is normally activated by ACh, but activation by GppNHp occurs in the absence of agonist occupation of the muscarinic receptor. 5. The increase in the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for forskolin produced by internal GppNHp was reversed by exposure to isoprenaline, which itself did not affect ICa amplitude. On average, exposure to isoprenaline in the presence of GppNHp caused an irreversible 81-fold decrease in the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for forskolin to 0.14 microM. Stimulation of ICa by forskolin after internal GppNHp and exposure to isoprenaline was completely <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by the protein kinase A <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> PKI(5-22). 6. These effects do not involve the phospholipase C system, because they are not mimicked by phorbol esters or internal inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and are not <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by bromophenacyl bromide or neomycin. 7. Direct effects of G proteins on ICa were not evident, because internal perfusion with PKI(5-22) completely inhibited isoprenaline- or forskolin-stimulated increases in ICa, and neither ACh nor internal GppNHp (30-500 microM) affected basal ICa or ICa elevated by internally perfused cyclic AMP. 8. These results suggest that the predominant site of action of the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> G protein activated by either GppNHp or ACh is adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, the internally perfused frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> may provide a useful approach for probing the detailed interactions of G proteins, forskolin, and adenylyl cyclase in an intact cell.</td>\n",

Striking voltage- and <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> effects of the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> \"agonist\" (+)-202-791 were revealed. From a holding potential of -60 mV, depolarizing test pulses in the presence of (+)-202-791 demonstrated a concentration-dependent (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>, 177 nM) increase in the measured peak inward barium current compared to control. In contrast, more depolarized holding potentials (greater than or equal to -30 mV) (+)-202-791 caused a biphasic effect on the peak inward current resulting in a transient enhancement followed by a steady-state <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>. A saturable, concentration-dependent hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of current inactivation was observed in the presence of (+)-202-791 with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 10.2 nM. The voltage dependence of current activation was also shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction in the presence of (+)-202-791. A <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> relative <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> by (+)-202-791 was observed after repetitive depolarizing test pulses at a frequency of 2 Hz. Thus, the single enantiomer (+)-202-791 can result in either an increase in the whole cell <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> current (favored by hyperpolarized holding potentials and low rates of stimulation) or <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> current (favored by depolarized holding potentials and high rates of stimulation). Various combinations of (-)-202-791, a reported <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, and (+)-202-791 resulted in intermediate effects on <span class=\"effect\">voltage sensitive</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> or barium currents compared with the presence of either enantiomer alone, and no clear cooperative interactions between the enantiomers were observed in contrast to a previous single <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> study (Kokuban S, Prod'ham B, Becker C, Porzig H, Reuter H: Studies on <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channels</span> in intact <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cells: <span class=\"effect\">Voltage-dependent</span> effects and cooperative interaction of <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> enantiomers. Mol Pharmacol 1986;30:571-584). The results are discussed in relation to the possible presence of multiple <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> receptors associated with the <span class=\"effect\">voltage sensitive</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span>.</td>\n",

The present study was undertaken to examine the responses of the sustained inward current (I(st)) to beta-adrenergic and muscarinic agonists in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> sino-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> (SA) node cells using the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. I(st) was detected as the <span class=\"chemicals\">nicardipine</span> (1 microM)-sensitive inward current at potentials between approximately -80 and +20 mV in the presence of low concentration (0.1 mM) of extracellular Ca2+, where the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (I(Ca,L)) was practically abolished. 2. Beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (ISO) in nanomolar concentrations not only increased the amplitude of I(st) but also shifted the membrane potential producing the peak amplitude (Vpeak) to a negative direction by approximately 15 mV without appreciably affecting potential range for the current activation. The stimulatory effect of ISO was concentration-dependent with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 2.26 nM and the maximal effect (96.4+/-22.9% increase, n=6) was obtained at 100 nM ISO, when evaluated by the responses at -50 mV. 3. Bath application of acetylcholine (ACh) significantly inhibited I(st), which had been maximally augmented by 100 nM ISO; this <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of ACh was concentration-dependent with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 133.9 nM. High concentration (1000 nM) of ACh depressed basal I(st) by 10.5+/-2.0% (n=3). 4. In action potential clamp experiments, I(st) was also detected under control conditions and was markedly potentiated by exposure to ISO. 5. These results strongly suggest that I(st) not only contributes to the spontaneous action potentials of mammalian SA node cells but also plays a substantial role in mediating autonomic regulation of SA node pacemaker activity.</td>\n",

Whole-cell currents were recorded in single, spontaneously active cells dissociated from porcine sino-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> node, and the conductance and gating properties of the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(K)) were investigated. 2. The isolated cells exhibited spontaneous action potentials at a rate of 80.5 +/- 5.4 min(-1) (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 11). Under Ca2+ current <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, (depolarization from -40 mV to various potentials activated a time-dependent outward current (I(K)). The activation curve of I(K) showed a half-activation potential (V1/2) of 20.5 +/- 2.1 mV and a slope factor (S) of 16.4 +/- 1.2 mV (n = 8). 3. As the duration of the depolarizing pulse to either +10 or +60 mV was prolonged, the amplitude of the tail current increased in proportion to that of the activated outward current during depolarization. 4. E4031 (2-5 microM), a selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> for the rapidly activating component of I(K) (I(K,r)), hardly affected I(K), but chromanol 293B, a selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> for the slowly activating component (I(K,s)), inhibited I(K) with an IC(50) of 8.79 microM. 5. The reversal potential of I(K) was -75.2 +/- 2.3 mV with 5.4 mM external and 150 mM internal K+. The time courses of activation and deactivation of I(K) were fitted by the sum of two exponential functions at various potentials. The relationship between the time constants and membrane potential showed a bell-shaped curve with a peak at around -10 mV for both fast and slow components. 6. The results indicate that in porcine sino-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> node cells I(K) is largely derived from I(K,s) and that I(K,s) plays a functional role in in the slow diastolic depolarization. I(K,s) may, in part, account for the relatively slower <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate of pigs than that of <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> in which I(K,r) is a functionally dominant component of I(K).</td>\n",

The dose-dependent stimulatory effects of isoprenaline (Iso, 0.1-100 microM) and forskolin (Fo. 0.1-50 microM) on ICa were determined in the presence and absence of acetylcholine (ACh, 10 microM) and/or threshold concentrations of Fo (0.2 microM) and Iso (0.05 microM), respectively. <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> (i.e. concentration of Iso or Fo at which the response was 50% of the maximum) and Emax (i.e. maximal stimulation of Ica expressed as percentage increase in ICa with respect to control) were measured under each condition. 2. ACh increased <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for the stimulatory action of Iso on ICa from 0.84 to 3.72 microM while it reduced Emax from 658 to 185%. Thus, ACh mainly reduced the efficacy of Iso to stimulate ICa. 3. ACh increased <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for the stimulatory action of Fo on ICa from 2.06 to 10.26 microM but only slightly reduced Emax from 893 to 778%. Thus, ACh mainly reduced the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of Fo to stimulate ICa. 4. Intracellular perfusion with 100 microM of hydrolysis-resistant GTP <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span>, GTP-gamma-S [guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)] and Gpp (NH)p (5'-guanylylimido-diphosphate), had no effect on basal ICa but reduced by greater than 50% the stimulatory effect of 2 microM-Iso on ICa. 5. In the presence of Gpp(NH)p or GTP-gamma-S, Fo (3 microM) reversibly increased ICa by 490%, as compared to a 717% increase in control (GTP) intracellular solution. Although ACh could still inhibit Fo-stimulated ICa, the degree of inhibition was significantly smaller than in the presence of GTP. 6. Extracellular perfusion with low concentrations of a combination of Iso (33 nM) and Fo (330 nM) enhanced ICa to a much greater extent than did either agent alone at 3 times higher concentrations. Thus, low concentrations of Iso and Fo appear to increase ICa in a synergistic fashion. 7. ICa stimulated by a combination of Iso and Fo appeared to be more resistant to inhibition by ACh than when stimulated by either alone. It was the efficacy, rather than the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>, of ACh to inhibit ICa that was reduced upon dual stimulation of ICa. 8. In the presence of 0.2 microM-Fo, <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> and Emax for the effects of Iso on ICa were 0.27 microM and 619%, respectively. By comparison with the effects of Iso alone, Fo reduced <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> approximately 3 times with no significant change in maximal stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</td>\n",

Functionally, Ran suppresses early afterdepolarization (EADs) and torsades de pointes (<span class=\"effect\">TdP</span>) in drug-induced long <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> type 2 (LQT2) presumably by decreasing intracellular [<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)](i) and Ca(2+)overload. However, simulations of EADs in LQT2 failed to predict their suppression by Ran. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the mechanism(s) whereby Ran alters <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> action potentials (APs) and cytosolic Ca(2+)transients and suppresses EADs and <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> in LQT2. METHODS: The known effects of Ran were included in simulations (Shannon and Mahajan models) of <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> APs and Ca(2+)transients in control and LQT2 models and compared with experimental optical mapping data from Langendorff <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> hearts treated with E4031 (0.5 μM) to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> the rapid delayed rectifying K(+)current. Direct effects of Ran on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ryanodine receptors (RyR2) were investigated in single <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> and changes in Ca(2+)-dependent high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>. RESULTS: Ran (10 μM) alone prolonged action potential durations (206 ± 4.6 to 240 ± 7.8 ms; P <0.05); E4031 prolonged action potential durations (204 ± 6 to 546 ± 35 ms; P <0.05) and elicited EADs and <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> that were suppressed by Ran (10 μM; n = 7 of 7 hearts). Simulations (Shannon but not Mahajan model) closely reproduced experimental data except for EAD suppression by Ran. Ran reduced open probability (P(o)) of RyR2 (half maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration = 10 ± 3 μM; n = 7) in bilayers and shifted half maximal effective concentration for Ca(2+)-dependent ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> from 0.42 ± 0.02 to 0.64 ± 0.02 μM with 30 μM Ran. CONCLUSIONS: Ran reduces P(o) of RyR2, desensitizes Ca(2+)-dependent RyR2 activation, and inhibits Ca(i) oscillations, which represents a novel mechanism for its suppression of EADs and <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span>.</td>\n",

Under switch <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span>, 2 mM streptomycin reduced the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) amplitude and (Ca(2+)-dependent) relative inactivation at positive membrane potentials and reduced the rapid and slow components of the delayed rectifier current (I(K)). This latter effect seemed Ca(2+)-dependent, not being seen when <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> and BAPTA were used to reduce intracellular Ca(2+). Fifty micromolars of streptomycin had no significant effects on any parameter studied. We conclude that the negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect of streptomycin results from <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of I(CaL), and thus, a reduction of intracellular Ca(2+) transients, while prolongation of the action potential is more consistent with effects on I(K).

The venom of stonefish is stored in the dorsal fine spines and contains a proteinaceous toxin, verrucotoxin (VTX). The stings produced by the spines induce intense pain, respiratory weakness, damage to the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> system, convulsions and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. Although there are many studies on VTX, the mechanism(s) underlying the VTX-mediated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiotoxicity</span> is not yet fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the modulation of ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> tissue by VTX. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of VTX on changes in the voltage or current in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes were investigated using a <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> method. KEY RESULTS: VTX (10 microg ml(-1)) prolonged the action potential duration by 2.5-fold. VTX increased <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) currents (I (Ca(L))) in a concentration-dependent manner with a EC(50) value of 7 microg ml(-1) and a maximum increase of 3.1-fold. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">propranolol</span> (1 microM) and the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, CGP20712A (10 microM) each abolished the effect of VTX (100 microg ml(-1)) on I (Ca(L)). Furthermore, the protein kinase A (PKA) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> H-89 (10 microM) and Rp-8-Br-cAMPS (30 microM) inhibited the effect of VTX on I (Ca(L)). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: VTX modulates <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>activity through the beta-adrenoceptor-cAMP-PKA pathway.</td>\n",

The physiological role of cGMP in regulation of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> activity is still controversial. cGMP may be of importance in regulation of I(Ca) in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells. The present study was focused on the role of cGMP in the modulation of I(Ca) in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells. METHODS: Enzymatically isolated adult <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells were used to measure I(Ca) using whole cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span>. Expressed levels of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) were determined by Western blotting using PKG specific antibody in homogenates from <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells. RESULTS: Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a nitric oxide donor that stimulates soluble guanylyl-cyclase to elevate cGMP levels increased I(Ca) while soluble G-cyclase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span>, ODQ or methylene blue inhibited I(Ca). Intracellular application of 8BrcGMP increased I(Ca) and <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of methylene blue. KT-5823, an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of PKG inhibited I(Ca) and the stimulatory effect of GSNO was completely <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> ODQ or KT-5823. Inhibition of cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) by the 6-22 peptide completely <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the stimulation of I(Ca) by the beta-agonist isoproterenol but not by GSNO. The <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of isoproterenol to stimulate I(Ca) was very high for <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells (EC(50) 2.4+/-0.6 nM) and only 100 nM isoproterenol was required to stimulate I(Ca) maximally (21.4+/-0.7 pA/pF) to a level (23.8+/-1.6 pA/pF) achieved with the inclusion of 100 microM cAMP in the pipette solution. GSNO produced an additive effect on I(Ca) already stimulated by either 10 microM isobutylmethylxanthine (phosphodiesterase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>) or a low concentration (1 nM) isoproterenol but failed to produce any effect on I(Ca) maximally stimulated by 100 nM isoproterenol. Inhibition of PKG by KT-5823 significantly decreased the efficacy of isoproterenol and the maximal I(Ca) achieved with 100 nM isoproterenol was decreased to 8.2+/-0.6 pA/pF in the presence of KT-5823. Western blot analysis showed much higher expression of PKG in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells compared to <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that stimulatory effects of cGMP on I(Ca) in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells are likely to be mediated via PKG dependent phosphorylation of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> or associated proteins and that the effects of cGMP are not <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> to cAMP.

The isolated cells exhibited spontaneous action potentials at a rate of 80.5 +/- 5.4 min-1 (mean +/- s.e.m., n = 11). Under Ca2+ current <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, depolarization from -40 mV to various potentials activated a time-dependent outward current (IK). The activation curve of IK showed a half-activation potential (V½) of 20.5 +/- 2.1 mV and a slope factor (S) of 16.4 +/- 1.2 mV (n = 8). As the duration of the depolarizing pulse to either +10 or +60 mV was prolonged, the amplitude of the tail current increased in proportion to that of the activated outward current during depolarization. E4031 (2-5 µM), a selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> for the rapidly activating component of IK (IK,r), hardly affected IK, but chromanol 293B, a selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> for the slowly activating component (IK,s), inhibited IK with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 8.79 µM. The reversal potential of IK was -75.2 +/- 2.3 mV with 5.4 mM external and 150 mM internal K+. The time courses of activation and deactivation of IK were fitted by the sum of two exponential functions at various potentials. The relationship between the time constants and membrane potential showed a bell-shaped curve with a peak at around -10 mV for both fast and slow components. The results indicate that in porcine sino-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> node cells IK is largely derived from IK,s and that IK,s plays a functional role in the slow diastolic depolarization. IK,s may, in part, account for the relatively slower <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate of pigs than that of <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> in which IK,r is a functionally dominant component of IK.</td>\n",

We intended to explore the effects of GSRd on <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I Ca,L) and define the mechanism of the suppression of I Ca,L by GSRd. METHODS: Perforated-patch recording and whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> techniques were applied in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. RESULTS: (1) GSRd reduced I Ca,L peak amplitude in a concentration-dependent manner [half-maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) = 32.4 ± 7.1 μmol/L] and up-shifted the current-voltage (I-V) curve. (2) GSRd (30 μmol/L) significantly changed the steady-state activation curve of I Ca,L (V 0.5: -19.12 ± 0.68 vs. -16.26 ± 0.38 mV; n = 5, p < 0.05) and slowed down the recovery of I Ca,L from inactivation [the time content (ζ) from 91 ms to 136 ms, n = 5, p < 0.01]. (3) A more significant inhibitive effect of GSRd (100 μmol/L) was identified in perforated-patch recording when compared with whole-cell recording [65.7 ± 3.2% (n = 10) vs. 31.4 ± 5.2% (n = 5), p < 0.01]. (4) Pertussis toxin (G i protein <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>) completely abolished the I Ca,L inhibition induced by GSRd. There was a significant difference in inhibition <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> between the two cyclic adenosine monophosphate elevating agents (isoprenaline and forskolin) prestimulation [55 ± 7.8% (n = 5) vs. 17.2 ± 3.5% (n = 5), p < 0.01]. (5) 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]-quinoxalin-1-one (a guanylate cyclase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>) and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (a nitric oxide scavenger) partly recovered the I Ca,L inhibition induced by GSRd. (6) Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (a protein kinase C activator) and GF109203X (a protein kinase C <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>) did not contribute to the inhibition of GSRd. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that GSRd could inhibit I Ca,L through pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (Gi) and a nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent mechanism.</td>\n",

The effects of purinoceptor stimulation by adenosine and ATP on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (ICa) were examined in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells from neonate and adult rabbits. ICa was measured by the membrane-perforated patch method. Adenosine inhibited the isoproterenol-stimulated ICa more potently in neonate cells than in adult cells. The high sensitivity of neonate myocytes to adenosine was accompanied not only by an increased maximum response but also by a lower <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> concentration. ATP also inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated ICa. The effect of ATP on neonate cells was stronger than that on adult cells at high concentrations (greater than or = 100 microM). The effect of adenosine was antagonized by an A1 adenosine receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX). DPCPX or an ecto-5'-nucleosidase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> (alpha,beta-methylene-ADP) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> most (approximately 60%) of the effect of ATP (30 microM), and co-addition of DPCPX and suramin (P2 receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>) abolished the effect of ATP. Suramin alone did not reduce the effect of ATP significantly in neonate cells. Both the effects of adenosine and ATP were eliminated by pre-treatment with pertussis toxin or by superfusion with forskolin plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (<span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span>). <span class=\"other_terms\">Inhibitors</span> of the nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway did not affect the adenosine inhibition of ICa. In summary, neonatal <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> cells are highly sensitive to adenosine A1 receptor stimulation. ATP stimulates both the adenosine A1 and P2 receptors. Adenosine A1 receptor stimulation, as a result of hydrolysis of ATP, predominantly mediates the effect of ATP, and the role of P2 receptors in the ATP inhibition of ICa is relatively small in neonate cells. The high sensitivity to adenosine may contribute to the ischemic tolerance of newborn hearts.</td>\n",

Recent clinical and experimental data suggest an important role of testosterone in sex-related differences in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> repolarization. However, studies on effects of testosterone on ionic currents in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes are limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined effects of testosterone on action potential duration (APD) and membrane currents in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes using <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques. Testosterone rapidly shortened APD, with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 2.1 to 8.7 nmol/L, which is within the limits of physiological testosterone levels in men. APD shortening by testosterone was mainly due to enhancement of slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ currents (IKs) and suppression of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ currents (I(Ca,L)), because testosterone failed to shorten APD in the presence of an IKs <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, chromanol 293B, and an I(Ca,L) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">nisoldipine</span>. A nitric oxide (NO) scavenger and an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of NO synthase 3 (NOS3) reversed the effects of testosterone on APD, which suggests that NO released from NOS3 is responsible for the <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects of testosterone. <span class=\"assays\">Electrophysiological</span> effects of testosterone were reversed by a <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of testosterone receptors, a c-Src <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, and an Akt <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>. Immunoblot analysis revealed that testosterone induced phosphorylation of Akt and NOS3. CONCLUSIONS: The nontranscriptional regulation of IKs and I(Ca,L) by testosterone is a novel regulatory mechanism of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> repolarization that can potentially contribute to the control of QTc intervals by androgen.</td>\n",

A fast perfusion system was used to analyse the kinetics of the response of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (ICa) to rapid applications and washouts of the <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> in whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamped</span> frog <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. 2. Both the inhibition of ICa induced by <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> and the recovery from inhibition upon washout of the drug behaved as mono-exponential functions of time. 3. During application or washout of 100 nM <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>, only the peak amplitude of ICa varied but not its time course of activation or inactivation. 4. The rate constant of the onset of ICa inhibition increased with the concentration of <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>. However, the time course of the recovery from inhibition was independent of drug concentration. 5. Both rate constants were strongly sensitive to the holding potential but insensitive to the test potential. 6. Using simple rate equations and a one-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span>-site analysis it was possible to determine the rate constants for association (k1) and dissociation (k-1) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the reaction between <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> and <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>. KD values for <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> were identical to <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values obtained from classical steady-state experiments. 7. With depolarized holding potentials, KD decreased strongly due to a large reduction in k-1 and a modest increase in k1. Assuming that these changes result from the distribution of <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> between resting and inactivated states, a low-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to the resting state (R) and a high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to the inactivated state (I) were obtained with the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> constants: k1R = 1.0 x 10(6) M-1 S-1, k-1R = 0.077 S-1, and KDR = 77 nM for the resting state; k1I = 4.47 x 10(6) M-1 S-1, k-1I = 7.7 x 10(-4) S-1, and KDI = 0.17 nM for the inactivated state. 8. Rapid application/washout experiments provide a unique way to determine, in an intact cell and in a relatively short period (2-4 min), the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> rate constants and the KD value of the reaction between a <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> and the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>.</td>\n",

At low frequencies (0.1 Hz) and negative holding potentials (-50 mV for <span class=\"calcium\">Ca currents</span> and -100 mV for <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> currents), <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> produced a concentration-dependent decrease in both Ca and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> currents without any significant change in the current-voltage relations. Concentration-response curves for <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of Ca and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were fitted by a one-to-one drug-receptor occupancy model. Half-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> concentrations (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> were 5 x 10(-7) M for <span class=\"calcium\">Ca currents</span> and 3 X 10(-5) M for <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> currents. <span class=\"chemicals\">Bepridil</span> had no effect on the inwardly rectifying K current and the time-dependent outward current. The effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> on Ca and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> currents depend upon the holding potential. Inactivation curves of the Ca and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> currents were shifted to more negative potentials by the drug. The recovery of both the Ca and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> currents from inactivation was always prolonged by <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> and the repriming of both currents usually displayed an added exponential component, attributed to slow release of the drug from the <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. The results indicate that <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span>, by inhibiting both Ca and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> currents, may have clinical usefulness in the treatment of certain ischemia-induced <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>.</td>\n",

The effects of R56865 (a new class of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> agent which prevents <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ and Ca2+ overload in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes) on catecholamine release, whole-cell current through <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> (IBa) and cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, [Ca2+]i, have been studied in bovine chromaffin cells. 2. R56865 caused a time- and concentration-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of catecholamine release from superfused cells stimulated intermittently with 5 s pulses of 59 mM K+. After 5 min superfusion, a 3 microM concentration inhibited secretion by 20%; the <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> increased gradually with perfusion time, to reach 85% after 40 min. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> secretion after 5 min periods of exposure to increasing concentrations of R56865 was around 3.1 microM. The <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effects of R56865 were reversible after 5-15 min wash out. In high Ca2+ solution (10 mM Ca2+), the degree of <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of secretion diminished by 20% in comparison with 1 mM Ca2+. 3. In electroporated cells, R56865 (10 microM) did not modify the secretory response induced by the application of 10 microM free Ca2+. 4. R56865 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the peak IBa current in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; its <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> was very similar to that obtained for secretion (3 microM). The <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> not only reduced the size of the peak current but also promoted its inactivation; when the effects of R56865 were measured at the most inactivated part of the current, its <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> was 1 microM. Both the inactivation and the reduction of the peak currents were reversible upon washing out the drug. 5. In fura-2-loaded single chromaffin cells the basal [Ca2+]i of around 100 nM was elevated to a peak of1.5 microM by the application of a 5 s pulse of 59 mM K+. R56865 (10 microM) did not affect the basal [Ca2+]but <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by 90% the K+-evoked increase. This effect was fully reversible after 5-10 min of wash out.6. The results are compatible with the idea that R56865 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> Ca2+ entry into K+-depolarized chromaffin cells by promoting the inactivation of <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>; this would lead to the limitation of the rise in [Ca2+]i and of the release of catecholamines. The restriction of catecholamine release may favour indirectly the known direct beneficial <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> actions of R56865.</td>\n",

In a stable HEK-293 cell line, we observed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the hERG current with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 252 microM. In freshly isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, pentamidine showed no effect on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current at concentrations up to 300 microM, with a slight prolongation of the action potential duration at this concentration. Since the effective concentrations of pentamidine on the hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> and APD were much higher than clinically relevant exposures (approximately 1 microM free or lower), we speculated that this drug might not prolong the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval through direct inhibition of I(Kr) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. We therefore incubated hERG-HEK cells in 1 and 10 microM pentamidine-containing media (supplemented with 10% serum) for 48 h, and examined the hERG current densities in the vehicle control and pentamidine-treated cells. In all, 36 and 85% reductions of the current densities were caused by 1- and 10-microM pentamidine treatment (P<0.001 vs control), respectively. A similar level of reduction of the hERG polypeptides and a reduced intensity of the hERG protein on the surface membrane in treated cells were observed by Western blot analysis and laser-scanning confocal microscopy, respectively. Taken together, our data imply that chronic administration of pentamidine at clinically relevant exposure reduces the membrane expression of the hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>, which may most likely be the major mechanism of <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> prolongation and <span class=\"effect\">torsade de pointes</span> reported in man.</td>\n",

Basal ICa was smaller in INF myocytes (1.2 +/- 0.1 pA/pF, n = 29, 6 +/- 1 mo old, 11 patients) than in YAD (2.5 +/- 0.2 pA/pF, n = 20, 16 +/- 1 yr old, 5 patients) or AD (2.6 +/- 0.3 pA/pF, n = 19, 66 +/- 3 yr old, 9 patients) myocytes (P < 0.05). Maximal ICa produced by isoproterenol (Iso) was similar in INF, YAD, and AD cells: 8.4 +/- 1.1, 9.6 +/- 1.0, and 9.2 +/- 1.3 pA/pF, respectively. Efficacy (Emax) was larger in INF (607 +/- 50%) than for YAD (371 +/- 29%) or AD (455 +/- 12%) myocytes. <span class=\"chem\">Potency</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>) was 8- to 10-fold higher in AD (0.82 +/- 0.09 nM) or YAD (0.41 +/- 0.14 nM) than in INF (7.6 +/- 3.5 nM) myocytes. Protein levels were similar for Gialpha2 but much greater for Gialpha3 in INF than in AD or YAD <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> tissue. When Gialpha3 activity was inhibited by inclusion of a Gialpha3 COOH-terminal decapeptide in the pipette, basal ICa and the response to 10 nM Iso were increased in INF, but not in YAD, cells. We propose that basal ICa and the response to low-dose beta-adrenergic stimulation are inhibited in INF (but not YAD or AD) cells as a result of constitutive <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects of Gialpha3.</td>\n",

Single myocytes were isolated from <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> sino-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> (SA) node by enzymatic dissociation. Spontaneous pacemaker activity, whole-cell and single-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> currents were recorded under conditions known to modulate ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. 2. The KATP <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> openers, cromakalim and pinacidil, slowed or abolished the pacemaker activity, and caused hyperpolarization of the maximum diastolic potential (MDP). Glibenclamide, a KATP <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>, reversed these effects. Cromakalim- and pinacidil-activated currents reversed near the potassium equilibrium potential, EK. Glibenclamide had no effect on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current, ICa(L), the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, If, or the delayed rectifier potassium current, IK. 3. <span class=\"sodium\">Sodium</span> cyanide, which inhibits mitochondrial ATP production, induced a macroscopic current that reversed near EK and was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by glibenclamide. 4. In excised, inside-out patches from SA node cells, single KATP <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> showed a slope conductance of 52 +/- 8 pS (mean +/- S.D.) when measurements were made at negative voltages in symmetric, 140 mM K+. <span class=\"calcium\">Channels</span> from <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes showed a somewhat larger slope conductance (70 +/- 5 pS). 5. Raising the intracellular ATP concentration caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the open probability of the KATP <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>, 16 microM; Hill coefficient, approximately 1; at both pH 7.4 and 6.8). 6. In excised inside-out patches, cromakalim or pinacidil induced significant increases in KATP <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity in the presence of 50 microM or 1 mM intracellular ATP. This <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by glibenclamide. 7. Our results suggest that sino-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> node cells express a distinct isoform of KATP <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> which may play an important role in pharmacological and pathophysiological modulation of pacemaker activity.</td>\n",

We investigated the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects of sertindole, an antipsychotic drug reported to prolong the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval in schizophrenic patients. In cell cultures, sertindole seemed to be a selective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of IHERG over other ion currents. For IHERG, the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value was 64 +/- 7 nM, whereas ISCN5A, <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>, ICa,T, IKCNQ1/KCNE1, and IKv4.3 were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> in the micromolar range. In canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value for IKr inhibition by sertindole was 107 +/- 21 nM. Action potentials in these cells prolonged in a reverse rate- and concentration-dependent manner at 10 to 300 nM sertindole. In vivo, sertindole was administered to anesthetized dogs at clinically relevant (0.05-0.20 mg/kg) and high doses (1.0-2.0 mg/kg) i.v. At 0.05 to 0.20 mg/kg sertindole (plasma concentrations 30-157 nM), QTc was prolonged by 1 to 5% in normal dogs and by 9 to 20% in dogs with remodeled hearts due to chronic atrioventricular <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> (CAVB). <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> was not induced at these doses in normal dogs or in CAVB dogs with reproducible induction of <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> by <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span> in previous experiments.

Initial experiments, performed using descending voltage ramps, showed that H-89 inhibited both the outward and inward ramp currents in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations between 5 and 60 micromol l(-1). A similar degree of inhibition was observed when I(to) and I(K1) were recorded using square wave depolarising and hyperpolarising voltage steps, respectively. 3. The IC(50) was 35.8 micromol l(-1) for I(to) and 27.8 micromol l(-1) for I(K1) compared to 5.4 micromol l(-1) for <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)). The Hill coefficients for I(to), I(K1) and I(Ca) were -1.97, -1.60 and -1.21, respectively. In addition to inhibiting I(to) amplitude, H-89 also accelerated the time to peak and the rate of <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> inactivation so that the time course of I(to) was abbreviated. 4. Paired-pulse protocols were performed to study the effects of H-89 on steady-state activation and inactivation as well as recovery from <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> inactivation. H-89 produced a concentration-dependent rightward shift in <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> activation but had no significant effect on steady-state inactivation. Recovery from <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> inactivation was delayed, although this was only visible at the highest concentration (60 micromol l(-1)) used. In experiments investigating the effects of elevated cyclic AMP, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline and the phosphatase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> calyculin A had no major effects on I(to) or I(K1). 6. Data suggest that the effects of H-89 on K(+) currents are more complex than simple inhibition of PKA-mediated phosphorylation.</td>\n",

AIM OF THE STUDY: The mechanism(s) which underline findings of severe adverse drug reactions (ADR) noted in more than a thousand published articles on CHIs, are still poorly understood. With 109 CHIs currently in clinical use, we investigated the proarrhythmic effects of three specific CHIs, Shuanghuanglian (SHL), Qingkailing (QKL) and Yinzhihuang (YZH), using in vivo and in vitro ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo and in vitro <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> electrocardiogram, intracellular action potential and <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> recording techniques were carried out. RESULTS: Both SHL and QKL (both in one, five and ten times clinically relevant doses (CRD) for in vivo and clinically relevant concentrations (CRC) for in vitro) prolonged P-R intervals in a dose or concentration-dependent manner and SHL also prolonged QTc. YZH (ten and 20 times CRD and CRC) prolonged P-R intervals without changing QTc. Intracellular action potential recordings from <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle indicated SHL and QKL abolished the firing of action potentials at ten and 30 times CRC respectively. SHL significantly suppressed <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current from left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes of <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span>, hNav1.5 current and hERG current with 50% inhibiting concentrations (IC(50)) of 6.0, 3.0 and 10.7 times CRC, respectively. Also, QKL significantly suppressed <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) and hNav1.5 currents with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC(50)s</span> of 10.7 and 13.8 times CRC. YZH significantly suppressed <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+), hNav1.5 and hERG currents with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC(50)s</span> of 12.1, 32.9 and 141.7 times CRC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The three CHIs studied caused bradyarrhythmia mainly by inhibiting <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) current and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current.</td>\n",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the new <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> dronedarone on <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+), Ca(2+) and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Monophasic action potentials (MAP) and effective refractory period (ERP) were studied in arterially perfused left atria and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> wedge preparations of the <span class=\"species\">pig</span>. Fast <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and Ca(2+) currents in isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes as well as <span class=\"species\">human</span> HCN4 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were investigated with the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. In left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> epicardial tissue, dronedarone (3 μM) had no effect on the MAP duration, but the drug caused a significant prolongation of the ERP from 145 ± 9 to 184 ± 17 ms (n = 6; p < 0.05). In <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, dronedarone exhibited a state-dependent inhibition of the fast <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> current with an IC(50) of 0.7 ± 0.1 μM, when the holding potential (V (hold)) was -80 mV. The maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> at the highest concentration used was 77 ± 8%. In contrast, when V (hold) was -100 mV, inhibition with 10 μM dronedarone was only 9 ± 3% (n = 7). Dronedarone <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> Ca(2+) currents elicited by rectangular pulses at V (hold) = -40 mV with an IC(50) value of 0.4 ± 0.1 μM (maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> by 10 μM dronedarone, 80 ± 6%), whereas at V (hold) = -80 mV, 10 μM dronedarone <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> only 20 ± 6% (n = 4) of the current. Applying an action potential clamp (V (hold) = -80 mV) yielded an IC(50) of 0.4 ± 0.3 μM. <span class=\"species\">Human</span> HCN4 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> expressed in CHO cells were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by dronedarone with an IC(50) of 1.0 ± 0.1 μM. Inhibition of fast <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> by dronedarone depends on the cell's resting membrane potential (state-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>) favouring an <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span>-selective mode of action. Besides fast <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span>, dronedarone also inhibits HCN4 currents.

EGCG is also available for consumption in the form of concentrated over-the-counter nutritional supplements. This <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of a number of diseases including multiple sclerosis, and a variety of cancers. To date, few data exist regarding the effects of EGCG on the <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiology</span> of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. Therefore, we examined the effects of EGCG on the electrocardiogram recorded from Langendorff-perfused <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> hearts and on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> using <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiology</span>. EGCG had no significant effects on the electrocardiogram at concentrations of 3 and 10 microM. At 30 microM, EGCG prolonged PR and QRS intervals, slightly shortened the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval, and altered the shape of the ST-T-wave segment. The ST segment merged with the upstroke of the T wave, and we noted a prolongation in the time from the peak of the T wave until the end. <span class=\"assays\">Patch-clamp</span> studies identified the KvLQT1/minK K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> as a <span class=\"calcium\">target</span> for EGCG (IC(50) = 30.1 microM). In addition, EGCG inhibited the cloned <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(v)1.5 in a <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> fashion. The <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>was inhibited by 20.8% at 30 microM, whereas the <span class=\"species\">human</span> ether-a-go-go-related gene and Kv4.3 <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were less sensitive to inhibition by EGCG. ECGC has a number of <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>, and these effects may have clinical significance when multigram doses of this <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> are used in <span class=\"species\">human</span> clinical trials or through self-ingestion of large amounts of over-the-counter products enriched in EGCG.</td>\n",

Sudden death resulted from <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> has been reported in clinic with acute trichloromethane intoxication. The present study was designed to investigate ionic mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenic effect (<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> toxicity) of trichloromethane in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hearts and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes and HEK 293 cells stably expressing <span class=\"species\">human</span> Nav1.5, HCN2, or hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> using conventional <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> approaches. It was found that trichloromethane (5mM) induced <span class=\"effect\">bradycardia</span> and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span>-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> conduction <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> or <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> fibrillation, and inhibited <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> contractile function in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hearts. It shortened action potential duration (APD) in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, and increased the threshold current for triggering action potential, but had no effect on the inward rectifier K(+) current I(K1). However, trichloromethane significantly inhibited the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current I(Ca.L) and the transient outward potassium current I(to) in a concentration-dependent manner (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC(50)s</span>: 1.01 and 2.4mM, respectively). In HEK 293 cells stably expressing <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> genes, trichloromethane reduced hNav1.5, HCN2, and hERG currents with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC(50)s</span> of 8.2, 3.3, and 4.0mM, respectively. These results demonstrate for the first time that trichloromethane can induce <span class=\"effect\">bradycardia</span> or <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> fibrillation, and the arrhythmogenic effect of trichloromethane is related to the inhibition of multiple ionic currents including I(Ca.L), I(to), I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>), HCN2, and hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.</td>\n",

The denopamine stimulation of ICa was abolished by selective beta 1 <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> (atenolol or bisoprolol). Pretreatment with forskolin or dialysis with cAMP also abolished the stimulation. Denopamine, in turn, inhibited ISO-stimulated ICa. This inhibition was not affected by pretreatment with pertussis toxin or prazosin. The presence of denopamine at various concentrations caused a rightward shift in the concentration/response curve for ISO stimulation of ICa. The Schild plot for this effect had a slope of 0.99 and Kp of 0.20 microM. In the presence of guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) (0.5 mM) in the pipette, denopamine (10 microM) stimulated the ICa to 86 +/- 5% of the maximum response induced by ISO. These findings indicate that denopamine modulates ICa exclusively through the beta 1 adrenoceptor-adenylate cyclase pathway, that the stimulatory GTP-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> protein regulates the agonistic <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of denopamine, and that the signal from the beta 1 adrenoceptors is amplified between ICa and the tension development, which would contribute to the spare capacity of beta adrenoceptors.</td>\n",

This study examined the effects of SR33805, a <span class=\"chemicals\">fantofarone</span> derivative with reported strong Ca(2+) -<span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> properties, on the contractile properties of intact and skinned <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. 2. On intact cells loaded with the Ca(2+)-fluorescent indicator Indo-1, the application of low concentrations of SR33805 enhanced the amplitude of unloaded cell shortening and decreased the duration of cell shortening. Amplitude of the Ca(2+) transient was also decreased. 3. These effects were accompanied with a shortening of the action potential and a dose-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (IC(50)=2.4 x 10(-8) M). 4. On skinned <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cells, the application of a low SR33805 concentration (10(-8) M) induced a significant increase in maximal Ca(2+)-activated force at the two-tested sarcomere lengths (SLs), 1.9 and 2.3 microm. 5. The application of a larger dose of SR33805 (10(-6)-10(-5) M) induced a significant leftward shift of the tension-pCa relation that accounts for Ca(2+)-sensitization of the myofilaments, particularly at 2.3 microm SL. 6. In conclusion, despite its strong Ca(2+)-<span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> properties SR33805 increases <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cell contractile activity as a consequence of its Ca(2+)-sensitizing effects. These effects are attributable to both an increase in the maximal Ca(2+)-activated force and a length-dependent Ca(2+)-sensitization.</td>\n",

Underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of TCCs in signal transduction in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> hypertrophy compared with <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> (LCCs). <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">Cardiomyocytes</span> dissociated from neonatal <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricles</span> were cultured until stabilization. Cell hypertrophy was induced by reapplication of 1% fatal bovine serum (FBS) following a period (24 h) of FBS depletion. Cell surface area increased from 862+/-73 microm2 to 2153+/-131 microm2 by FBS stimulation in control (250+/-1.8%). T-type Ca2+ current (I(CaT)) was inhibited dose-dependently by kurtoxin (KT) and <span class=\"chemicals\">efonidipine</span> (ED) with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> 0.07 microM and 3.2 microM, respectively in whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span>. On the other hand, 1 microM KT which inhibits I(CaT) over 90% did not effect on <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (I(CaL)). 10 microM ED had the ability of I(CaL) <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> as well as that of I(CaT) <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>. 3 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">nisoldipine</span> (ND) suppressed I(CaL) by over 80%. The increase in cell surface area following reapplication of FBS as observed in control (250+/-1.8%) was significantly reduced in the presence of 1 microM KT (216+/-1.2%) and virtually abolished in the presence of 10 microM ED (97+/-0.8%) and 3 microM ND (80+/-1.1%). Hypertrophy was associated with an increase in BNP mRNA of 316+/-3.6% in control and this increase was reduced as well in the presence of 1 microM KT (254+/-1.8%) and almost abolished in the presence of 10 microM ED (116+/-1.1%) and 3 muM ND (93+/-0.8%). Immunolabeling showed that translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT3) into the nucleus in response to FBS stimulation was markedly inhibited by either KT or ED as well as ND. Calcineurin phosphatase activity was upregulated 2.2-fold by FBS, but KT, ED and ND decreased this upregulation (1.7-fold, 0.8-fold, and 0.7-fold with KT, ED and ND respectively). These results suggest that <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of Ca2+ entry into <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> via TCCs may <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> pathophysiological signaling pathways leading to hypertrophy as well as via LCCs. The mechanism may be the inhibition of calcineurin-mediated NFAT3 activation resulting in prevention of its translocation into the nucleus.</td>\n",

T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> have been recognized recently in the mechanisms underlying <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>. However, it is unclear whether carvedilol may affect the T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel</span>. The present study evaluated the pharmacological effects of carvedilol on T-type <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (I(Ca,T)) in the murine HL-1 cell line. I(Ca)(,T) was recorded by the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. <span class=\"calcium\">Calcium</span> transient was monitored by the fluorescent dye Fluo-4/AM and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Carvedilol reversibly inhibited I(Ca)(,T) in a concentration-dependent manner, with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 2.1 microM. 3 microM carvedilol was found to decrease the peak I(Ca)(,T) amplitude at -20 mV from 20.1+/-1.8pA/pF to 10.9+/-2.1pA/pF. Carvedilol significantly shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of I(Ca)(,T) towards more negative potential by 12.8 mV, while the activation curve was not significantly altered. Carvedilol delayed recovery from inactivation of I(Ca)(,T), time constant (tau) was 112.4+/-3.5 ms in control and 270.1+/-4.7 ms in carvedilol. Carvedilol-induced inhibition rate in I(Ca)(,T) was enhanced with the increase in stimuli frequency, the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> rate was 23.2+/-4.1% at 0.2 Hz and 47.2+/-0.6% at 2 Hz. Carvedilol still produced the significant decrease in the amplitude of I(Ca)(,T) in the presence of H-89, PKA <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>.

The effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on sinoatrial (SA) node preparations of the <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> were studied by means of whole-cell clamp techniques. 2. ET-1 at 1 nM slowed the spontaneous beating activity and rendered half of the cells quiescent. At a higher concentration of 10 nM, the slowing and cessation of spontaneous activity were accompanied by hyperpolarization. 3. In <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> experiments, ET-1 decreased the basal <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (Ica(L)) dose-dependently with a half-maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>) of 0.42 nM and maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> response (Emax) of 49.5%. The delayed rectifying K+ current (Ik) was also reduced by 33.2 +/- 11.1% at 1 nM. In addition an inwardly rectifying K+ current was activated by ET-1 at higher concentrations (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 4.8 nM). These ET-1-induced changes in membrane currents were abolished by BQ485 (0.3 microM), a highly selective ETA receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>. 4. When Ica(L) was inhibited by ET-1 (1 nM), subsequent application of 10 microM ACh showed no additional decrease in Ica(L), suggesting the involvement of cyclic AMP in the effects of ET-1 on Ica(L). In contrast, 1 nM ET-1 further decreased Ica(L) in the presence of 10 microM ACh, suggesting that ET-1 activates some additional mechanism(s) which inhibit Ica(L). The ET-1-induced Ica(L) inhibition was abolished by protein kinase A <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> peptide (PKI, 20 microM) or H-89 (5 microM). However, the Ica(L) inhibition was not affected by methylene blue (10 microM), suggesting a minor role for cyclic GMP in the effect of ET-1 under basal conditions. 5. ET-1 failed to inhibit Ica(L) when the pipette contained GDP beta S (200 microM). However, incubation of the 21.5 +/- 9.5%, whereas it abolished the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of ACh on Ica(L). 6. Intracellular perfusion of 8-bromo cyclicAMP (8-Br cyclicAMP, 500 microM) attenuated, but did not abolish the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of ET-1 on Ica(L). This 8-Br cyclicAMP-resistant component (17.5 +/- 14.4%, n = 20) was not affected by combined application of 8-Br cyclicAMP-bromo cyclicGMP (500 microM), ryanodine (1 microM) or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (TPA; 50 nM). 7. In summary, ET-1 exerts negative chronotropic effects on the SA node via ETA-receptors. ET-1 inhibits both ICa(L) and Ik, and increases background K+ current. The inhibition of ICa(L) by ET-1 is mainly due to reduction of the cyclicAMP levels via PTX-sensitive G protein, but some other mechanism(s) also seems to be operative.</td>\n",

(guava) leaves. However, in spite of its widespread use in Brazilian folk medicine and a reasonable number of scientific reports about it, we could not find any study dealing with its action on the mammalian <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span>. In the present study, by measuring isometric force, we observed that the crude extract of P. guajava (water-alcohol extract obtained by macerating dry leaves) depresses the <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> contractility in a concentration-dependent fashion (N = 8 hearts, 15 trials). The <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> with <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> activity was concentrated by extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus using 17 M glacial acetic acid after removing the less polar fractions (hexane, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and methanol), suggesting that this <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> is a highly polar substance. In the isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span> the acetic acid fraction (10-800 mg/l) of P. guajava 1) reversibly decreased <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> force in a concentration-dependent fashion (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 0.07g/l, N = 5 hearts, 9 trials, P<0.05), 2) increased the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> relaxation time measured at 20% of the force amplitude up to 35% (91 +/- 15 to 123 +/- 30 ms, N = 3 hearts, 6 trials, P<0.05), 3) abolished the positive staircase effect (Bowditch phenomenon) in a concentration-dependent fashion suggesting a decrease of the cellular inward <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (N = 4 hearts, 8 trials, P<0.05), and 4) its <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect was abolished by cholinergic receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> with 1.5 mM atropine sulfate, indicating a cholinergic involvement in the mechanism of action of the extract (N = 7 hearts, 15 trials, P<0.05). The acetic acid extract was 20 times more potent than crude extract (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 1.4 g/l). The results showed that extracts from P. guajava leaves depress <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> <span class=\"effect\">inotropism</span>.</td>\n",

METHODS: hKv1.5 and Kv4.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were stably and transiently expressed in <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> fibroblast and Chinese hamster ovary cells, respectively. Currents were recorded using the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span>. RESULTS: <span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span> (0.01 nM-500 muM) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> hKv1.5 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, in a frequency-dependent manner exhibiting a biphasic dose-response curve (IC(50)=4.8+/-1.5 nM and 42.3+/-3.6 muM). <span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span> delayed the initial phase of the tail current decline and shifted the midpoint of the activation (Vh=-16.5+/-2.1 mV vs -20.4+/-2.6 mV, P<0.001) and inactivation (Vh=-22.4+/-0.7 mV vs. -28.2+/-1.9 mV, P<0.001) curves to more negative potentials. The analysis of the development of the <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>-induced <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> yielded apparent association (k) and dissociation (P) rate constants of (1.6+/-0.2) x 10(6) M(-1)s(-1) and 46.8+/-4.8 s(-1), respectively. <span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span> (0.1 nM-100 muM) also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> Kv4.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in a frequency-dependent manner exhibiting a biphasic dose-response curve (IC(50)=62.6+/-11.1 nM and 109.9+/-12.8 muM). <span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span> decreased the peak current and, at concentrations > or =0.1 microM, accelerated the inactivation time course. The apparent association and dissociation rate constants resulted (1.7+/-0.2) x 10(6) M(-1)s(-1) and 258.6+/-38.1 s(-1), respectively. <span class=\"chemicals\">Diltiazem</span>, 10 nM, shifted to more negative potentials the voltage-dependence of Kv4.3 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> inactivation (Vh=-33.1+/-2.3 mV vs -38.2+/-3.5 mV, n=6, Plt;0.05) the <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> increasing at potentials at which the amount of inactivated <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> increased.

With intrapipette guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (100 microM), a specific inhibition of G1 proteins by pertussis toxin (PTX) produced an increase in the basal density of I(Ca,L) (from 11.0+/-0.8, n = 13, to 25.0+/-2.0 pA/pF, n = 11, at OmV test potential). In addition, PTX shifted the forskolin (Fsk) concentration-I(Ca,L) response relation significantly leftward (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>, = 63.7+/-12.5 vs 625+/-75 nM). With intrapipette guanosine diphosphate (GDP)betaS (1 mM), the Fsk-I(Ca,L) relation was also shifted leftward (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 197+/-18.3 vs 781+/-82.5 nM). However, chronic GDPbetaS dialysis accelerated the rundown of I(Ca,L) significantly, suggesting a potential contribution of Gs proteins in maintaining basal I(Ca,L). In contrast, intra-pipette GTPgammaS (100 microM) produced a transient rise in I(Ca,L) from 11.0+/-3.0 to 22.8+/-7.0 pA/pF (in 3.4 min after whole-cell formation at 0 mV, n = 9), presumably through the activation of Gs proteins. It was followed by a gradual decline in I(Ca,L) (to 15.5+/-3.5 pA/pF), which was still enhanced by Fsk (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 1450+/-98 nM), indicating that the current decay was not solely due to rundown but to activation of Gi proteins. Gs, in addition to Gi proteins, show sufficient basal activity to modulate I(Ca,L) in an agonist-independent manner.</td>\n",

METHODS: SAA powder was dissolved in normal Tyrode's solution to reach the concentrations of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 μmol/L. The traditional whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> recording technique was employed to evaluate the effects of SAA on I-CaL in single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes which were prepared by Langendorff perfusion apparatus from Sprague-Dawley rats. RESULTS: SAA (1, 10, 100, and 1000 μmol/L) inhibited I-CaL peak value by 16.23%±1.3% (n=6, P<0.05), 22.9%±3.6% (n=6, P<0.05), 53.4%±3.0% (n=8, P<0.01), and 62.26%±2.9% (n=6, P<0.01), respectively. SAA reversibly inhibited I-CaL in a dose-dependent manner and with a half-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> concentration (IC(50)) of 38.3 μmol/L. SAA at 100 μmol/L elevated the I-V curve obviously, and shifted the half-active voltage (V(0.5)) from (-15.78±0.86) mV to (-11.24 ±0.77) mV (n=6, P<0.05) and the slope (K) from 5.33±0.74 to 4.35±0.74 (n=6, P>0.05). However, it did not alter the shapes of I-V curve, steady-state inactivation curve, or recovery from inactivation curve. CONCLUSIONS: SAA inhibited I-CaL in a dose-dependent manner. It shifted the steady-state activation curve to a more positive voltage, which indicated that the drug affected the activated state of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, and suggested that the Ca(2+) <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> effect of SAA be beneficial in the treatment of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> ischemia reperfusion injury.</td>\n",

The selective oestrogen (ER) receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">modulator</span>, raloxifene, is widely used in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, but may also possess <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> properties. We investigated whether it directly suppresses myocyte contractility through <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span><span class=\"other_terms\">antagonism</span> in a similar way to 17beta-oestradiol. 2. Cell shortening and Ca(2+) transients were measured in single <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes field-stimulated (1 Hz, 37 degrees C) in a superfusion chamber. <span class=\"assays\">Electrophysiological</span> recordings were performed using single electrode <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span>. 3. Raloxifene decreased cell shortening (EC(50) 2.4 microm) and the Ca(2+) transient amplitude (EC(50) 6.4 microm) in a concentration-dependent manner. At a concentration of 1 microm, raloxifene produced a 33+/-2% (mean+/-s.e.m) and 24+/-2% reduction, respectively (P<0.001, n=14 for both parameters). 4. These <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> actions were not observed in myocytes that had been incubated with the specific <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, ICI 182,780 (10 microm) (n=11). 5. Raloxifene (1 microm) shortened action potential durations at 50 and 90% repolarisation (P<0.05 and <0.001, respectively; n=27) and decreased peak <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current by 45%, from -5.1+/-0.5 pA/pF to -2.8+/-0.3 pA/pF (P<0.001, n=18). 6. Raloxifene did not significantly alter sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content, as assessed by integrating the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger currents following rapid caffeine application. 7. The present study provides evidence for direct <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> actions of raloxifene on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocyte contractility, mediated through <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span><span class=\"other_terms\">antagonism</span>.</td>\n",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Contractility was measured in ex vivo Langendorff-perfused hearts isolated from Wistar rats. Isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> were used to analyse intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> ([Ca(2+)](i)) transients evoked by electrical stimulation and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current by confocal microscopy and whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamping</span>, respectively. The application of Ucn to perfused hearts induced progressive, sustained, and potent <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> and <span class=\"effect\">lusitropic</span> effects that were dose-dependent with an EC(50) of approximately 8 nM. Ucn effects were independent of protein kinase A (PKA) activation but were significantly reduced by protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> and by brefeldin A, an <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> of guanine nucleotide exchange factor, suggested to be an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac). These whole-organ effects were correlated with the <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effects observed in isolated cells: Ucn increased I(CaL) density, [Ca(2+)](i) transients, cell shortening and Ca(2+) content of sarcoplasmic reticulum. CONCLUSION: Our results show that Ucn evokes potent positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> and <span class=\"effect\">lusitropic</span> effects mediated, at least in part, by an increase in I(CaL) and [Ca(2+)](i) transient amplitude. These effects may involve the activation of Epac, PKC, and MAPK signalling pathways.</td>\n",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes were investigated using whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span>, western-blot and qRT-PCR techniques. Pirfenidone increased the density of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(CaL,) 50-100%), without significantly altering <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+), K(+), or T-type Ca(2+) currents. The effect was dose-dependent, with an EC(50) of 2.8 µM. Its onset was slow, with a lag period larger than 1 h and time to maximum of 24-48 h. Concomitant changes were observed in the <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> activation of I(CaL) (-5 mV shift in both V(1/2) and k). In contrast, the following properties of I(CaL) remained normal: steady-state inactivation, Ca(V)1.2 levels (mRNA and protein), and intramembrane charge movement. Indeed, the conductance-to-charge ratio, or G(max)/Q(max), was increased by 80%. The effect on I(CaL) was mimicked by an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS), and attenuated by both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span>. Conversely, cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and Ca(2+) were all ruled out as possible intermediaries. Additional experiments suggest that pirfenidone increases action potential duration by ∼50%. CONCLUSION: Pirfenidone augments I(CaL), not through higher expression of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, but through promoting their Ca(2+)-conducting activity. A possible inhibition of NOS expression is likely involved, with subsequent reduced NO production and stimulated cAMP/PKA signalling. These findings may be relevant to the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> effect of pirfenidone.</td>\n",

The actions and mechanisms of action of novel <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> of <span class=\"chemicals\">sotalol</span> which prolong <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> action potentials were investigated in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> and <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells. 2. In <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> and <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> cells the <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> significantly prolonged action potential duration at 20% and 90% repolarization levels without affecting resting membrane potential. In <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> but not <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> cells there was an increase in action potential amplitude and in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> cells there was no change in the shape or position of the 'notch' in the action potential. 3. Possible mechanisms of action were studied in more detail in the case of <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> II (1-(4-methanesulphonamidophenoxy)-3-(N-methyl 3,4 dichlorophenylethylamino)-2-propanol). Prolongation of action potential duration continued to occur in the presence of <span class=\"chemicals\">nisoldipine</span>, and <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents recorded under <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> conditions were not reduced by <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> II (1 microM). Action potential prolongation by <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> II was also unaffected in the presence of 10 microM tetrodotoxin. 4. <span class=\"chem\">Compound</span> II (1 microM) did not influence IK1 assessed from the current during ramp changes in membrane potential (20 mV s-1) over the range -90 to -10 mV. 5. <span class=\"chem\">Compound</span> II (1 microM) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> time-dependent delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) activated by step depolarizations and recorded as an outward tail following repolarization. When a submaximal concentration (50 nM) was applied there was no change in the apparent reversal potential of IK.6. Submaximal concentrations of <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> II were without effect on activation of IK with time at a membrane potential of + 40 mV, and no changes were detected in the time constants of the two components of IK decay over the range of potentials - 60 to 0 mV. <span class=\"chem\">Compound</span> 11 (50 nM) appeared to cause a small shift in the activation of IK with membrane potential (an apparent shift of approximately 10mV in the depolarizing direction at the mid-point of the curve).7. Log dose-response curves for action potential prolongation and for <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of IK by <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> II were similar. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> II was approximately 30 nM.8. It is concluded that this novel series of <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> prolongs action potential duration, and that in the case of <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> II the evidence supports a potent selective effect on the time-dependent potassium current IK, an effect which can account for this prolongation.</td>\n",

In this study, the immediate effect of Ang II on action potentials and ionic currents were investigated by using whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamps</span> in single <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> SA node pacemaker cells. We demonstrated that Ang II exerted a negative effect on spontaneous firing rate, with a concomitant reduction in the slope of diastolic depolarization. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of Ang II on spontaneous activity displayed a concentration-dependent manner in the range of 1-1000 nM, with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 8.34 nM. Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> valsartan (1 μM) abolished the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect. In contrast, Ang II type 2 (AT2) receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, PD123319 (1 μM) didn't affect the action of Ang II. Ang II had no significant effect on hyperpolarization-activated current (If) in SA node cells. However, it significantly slowed the deactivation of the slowly activated delayed rectifier K+ current (Iks) and increased the tail current density. Furthermore, Ang II decreased the current density of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current in SA node cells. Our data demonstrate that Ang II reduces the auto rhythm of SA node cells via enhancing Iks and reducing ICaL. The result suggests a potential mechanism by which elevated levels of Ang II may be involved in the occurrence of SA node dysfunction in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> pathophysiology.</td>\n",

Amiodarone is effective against both <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> by intravenous (i.v.) or oral route. However, the i.v. formulation has limitations. Therefore, we identified SAR114646A, an amiodarone-like <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> agent with good aqueous solubility suitable for i.v. application. <span class=\"assays\">Patch-clamp</span> experiments were performed with isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> from guinea pigs and rats. In <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, the fast <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> and the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span> were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by SAR114646A with half-maximal concentrations (IC(50)) of 2.0 and 1.1 μM, respectively. The tail current of the fast activating rectifying potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> I(Kr) was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> with an IC(50) value of 0.6 μM, whereas the IC(50) values for inhibition of the I(Ks) and I(K1) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> was >10 μM. ATP-sensitive K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were evoked by application of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> opener rilmakalim (3 μM). SAR114646A <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> this current with an IC(50) value of 2.8 μM. In <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, carbachol (1 μM) was used to activate the I(KACh) and SAR114646A inhibited this current with IC(50) of 36.5 nM. The transient outward current I(to) and the sustained current I(sus) were investigated in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. SAR114646A <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> these currents with IC(50) of 1.8 and 1.2 μM, respectively. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the currents hKv1.5 and hHCN4 were inhibited with IC(50) values of 1.1 and 0.4 μM, respectively. Micropuncture experiments in isolated <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> left atria revealed that SAR114646A prolonged the 50% repolarization significantly at 3 and 10 μM. In <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle, the APD at 90% of repolarization was slightly prolonged at 3 and 10 μM. SAR114646A demonstrates <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> activity in anaesthetised rats, subjected to 5 min ischemia followed by 10 min reperfusion, where 1 mg/kg of SAR114646A applied as i.v. bolus 5 min prior to ischemia, decreased mortality to 0% compared to 80% under control conditions. In conclusion, SAR114646A is a multichannel <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> with improved water solubility, compared to amiodarone. In contrast to amiodarone, SAR114646A also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> the K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> I(to) and I(sus).

To evaluate the potential mechanisms and consequences, we studied: (i) Ranolazine's effects on HERG and IsK currents in Xenopus oocytes with two-electrode <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span>; (ii) effects of ranolazine, compared to d-<span class=\"chemicals\">sotalol</span>, on effective refractory period (ERP), <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> rhythm in a <span class=\"species\">dog</span> model of acquired long <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> syndrome; and (iii) effects on selected native currents in canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes with whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. Ranolazine inhibited HERG and IsK currents with different <span class=\"chem\">potencies</span>. HERG was inhibited with an IC(50) of 106 micromol l(-1), whereas the IC(50) for IsK was 1.7 mmol l(-1). d-<span class=\"chemicals\">Sotalol</span> caused reverse <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> ERP and <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval prolongation, whereas ranolazine produced modest, nonsignificant increases that plateaued at submaximal doses. Neither drug affected QRS duration. d-<span class=\"chemicals\">Sotalol</span> had clear proarrhythmic effects, with all d-<span class=\"chemicals\">sotalol</span>-treated dogs developing torsades de pointes (<span class=\"effect\">TdP</span>) <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> tachyarrhythmias, of which they ultimately died. In contrast, ranolazine did not generate <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span>. Effects on I(Kr) and I(Ks) were similar to those on HERG and IsK. Ranolazine <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(Ca) with an IC(50) of approximately 300 micromol l(-1). I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) was unaffected. We conclude that ranolazine inhibits I(Kr) by <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> HERG currents, inhibits I(Ca) at slightly larger concentrations, and has modest and self-limited effects on the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval. Unlike d-<span class=\"chemicals\">sotalol</span>, ranolazine does not cause <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> in a <span class=\"species\">dog</span> model. The greater safety of ranolazine may be due to its ability to inhibit I(Ca) at concentrations only slightly larger than those that inhibit I(Kr), thus producing offsetting effects on repolarization.</td>\n",

Tedisamil is a new <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> drug with predominant class III action. The aim of the present study was to investigate the <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> pattern of the <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> on the transient outward current (I(to)) in <span class=\"species\">human</span> subepicardial myocytes isolated from explanted left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricles</span>. Using the single electrode whole cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> technique, I(to) was analysed after appropriate voltage inactivation of <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> current and <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current. 2. Tedisamil reduced the amplitude of peak I(to), but did not affect the amplitude of non-inactivating outward current. The drug accelerated the apparent rate of I(to) inactivation. The reduction in time constant of I(to) inactivation depended on drug concentration, the apparent <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value was 4.4 microM. 3. Tedisamil affected I(to) amplitude in a <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> manner. After 2 min at -80 mV, maximum <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(to) was reached after 4-5 clamp steps either at the frequency of 0.2 or 2 Hz, indicating that the <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was not frequency-dependent in an experimentally relevant range. Recovery from <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was very slow and proceeded with a time constant of 12.1+/-1.8 s. Also in the presence of drug, a fraction of <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> recovered from inactivation with a similar time constant as in control myocytes (i.e. 81+/-40 ms and 51+/-8 ms, respectively, n.s.). 4. From the onset of fractional <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of I(to) by tedisamil during the initial 60 ms of a clamp step, we calculated k1 = 9 x 10(6) mol(-1) s(-1) for the association rate constant, and k2 = 23 s(-1) for the dissociation rate constant. The resulting apparent KD was 2.6 microM and is similar to the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value. 5. The effects of tedisamil on I(to) could be simulated by assuming a four state <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> model where the drug binds to the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> in an open (activated) conformation. It is concluded that in <span class=\"species\">human</span> subepicardial myocytes tedisamil is an open <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of I(to) and that this effect probably contributes to the <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> potential of this drug.</td>\n",

Following up on our earlier work, we tested the hypothesis that this type of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> transport can disrupt <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> electromechanical stability. Our Western and immunofluorescence analyses show that left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes express the Orai1 and the Orai3 <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Adding the Orai activator 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) to the superfusate of <span class=\"species\">rat</span> left atria causes these non-automatic muscles to contract spontaneously and persistently at rates of up to 10 Hz, and to produce normal action potentials from normal resting potentials, all in the absence of external stimulation. 2-APB likewise induces such automatic activity in superfused <span class=\"species\">rat</span> left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles, and the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC(50)s</span> at which 2-APB induces this activity in both muscles are similar to the concentrations which activate Orais.

Concentration-dependent effects of thymol (1 - 1000 microM) was studied on action potential configuration and ionic currents in isolated canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> using conventional microelectrode and <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> techniques. 2. Low concentration of thymol (10 microM) removed the notch of the action potential, whereas high concentrations (100 microM or higher) caused an additional shortening of action potential duration accompanied by progressive depression of plateau and reduction of V(max). 3. In the canine cells <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> (I(Ca)) was decreased by thymol in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50): 158+/-7 microM, Hill coeff.: 2.96+/-0.43). In addition, thymol (50 - 250 microM) accelerated the inactivation of I(Ca), increased the time constant of recovery from inactivation, shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of I(Ca) leftwards, but voltage dependence of activation remained unaltered. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with thymol in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes isolated from healthy <span class=\"species\">human</span> hearts. 4. Thymol displayed concentration-dependent suppressive effects on potassium currents: the transient outward current, I(to) (EC(50): 60.6+/-11.4 microM, Hill coeff.: 1.03+/-0.11), the rapid component of the delayed rectifier, I(Kr) (EC(50): 63.4+/-6.1 microM, Hill coeff.: 1.29+/-0.15), and the slow component of the delayed rectifier, I(Ks) (EC(50): 202+/-11 microM, Hill coeff.: 0.72+/-0.14), however, K <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> kinetics were not much altered by thymol. These effects on Ca and K currents developed rapidly (within 0.5 min) and were readily reversible. 5. In conclusion, thymol suppressed <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ionic <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in a concentration-dependent manner, however, both drug-sensitivities as well as the mechanism of action seems to be different when <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> and potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>.</td>\n",

In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle, the drug prolonged the action potential duration (APD) in a concentration-dependent manner at a cycle length (CL) of 1000 ms. In Purkinje fibers, at the same CL, the concentration-dependent lengthening of the APD was observed in the presence of up to 3 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">azimilide</span> (at 3.0 microM: 24.1+/-4.2%, n=9); at higher drug concentration, no further APD prolongation was observed. <span class=\"chemicals\">Azimilide</span> lengthened APD in a reverse frequency-dependent manner in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle and Purkinje fibers alike. <span class=\"chemicals\">Azimilide</span> (10 microM) caused a rate-dependent depression in the maximal upstroke velocity of the action potential (V(max)) in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle. The time and rate constants of the offset and onset kinetics of this V(max) <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> were 1754+/-267 ms (n=6) and 5.1+/-0.4 beats (n=6), respectively. <span class=\"chemicals\">Azimilide</span> did not prevent the APD shortening effect of 10 microM pinacidil in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle, suggesting that the drug does not influence the ATP-sensitive K(+) current. <span class=\"chemicals\">Azimilide</span> inhibited the rapid (I(Kr)) and slow component (I(Ks)) of the delayed rectifier K(+) current and the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)). The estimated EC(50) value of the drug was 0.59 microM for I(Ks), 0.39 microM for I(Kr) and 7.5 microM for I(Ca). The transient outward (I(to)) and the inward rectifier (I(k1)) K(+) currents were not influenced by the drug. It is concluded that the site of action of <span class=\"chemicals\">azimilide</span> is multiple, it inhibits not only K(+) (I(Kr), I(Ks)) currents but, in higher concentrations, it also exerts <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span>- and <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>.</td>\n",

In the <span class=\"species\">rat</span> DRG cells, SB 206284A caused almost complete <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of the sustained inward Ca2+ current (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 2.4 microM), suggesting that the <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> is an effective <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of slowly inactivating, high-voltage <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current. SB 206284A reduced locomotor hyperactivity in the gerbil bilateral carotid artery occlusion model without affecting ischemia-induced damage in the hippocampal CA1 region. In the <span class=\"species\">rat</span> middle cerebral artery occlusion model, SB 206284A reduced lesion volume in the posterior forebrain, and in the <span class=\"species\">rat</span> photochemical cortical lesion model, lesion volume was reduced even when treatment was delayed until 4 hours after occlusion. At neuroprotective doses, SB 206284A had no <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> effects. These findings show that SB 206284A is a novel <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> that shows neuroprotective properties.</td>\n",

In isolated perfused <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hearts, infusion of apelin (0.01 to 10 nmol/L) induced a dose-dependent positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>: 33.1+/-1.5 pmol/L). Moreover, preload-induced increase in dP/dt(max) was significantly augmented (P<0.05) in the presence of apelin. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U-73122 and suppression of protein kinase C (PKC) with staurosporine and GF-109203X markedly attenuated the apelin-induced <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect (P<0.001). In addition, zoniporide, a selective <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+-H+ exchange (NHE) isoform-1, and KB-R7943, a potent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of the reverse mode <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+-Ca2+ exchange (NCX), significantly suppressed the response to apelin (P<0.001). Perforated <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> recordings showed that apelin did not modulate <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current or voltage-activated K+ currents in isolated adult <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Apelin mRNA was markedly downregulated in cultured neonatal <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes subjected to mechanical stretch and in vivo in two models of chronic <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> pressure overload. The present study provides the first evidence for the physiological significance of apelin in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. Our results show that apelin is one of the most potent endogenous positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> substances yet identified and that the <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> response to apelin may involve activation of PLC, PKC, and sarcolemmal NHE and NCX.</td>\n",

The atrioventricular node (AVN) is an important part of the conduction system in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> and is a significant site of <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> drug action. The class 1 <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> is effective in treating a variety of <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>, including those involving the AVN. In this study, we have investigated the effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> on ionic currents in single <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> AVN cells, focusing in particular on those on <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>). 2. With a standard K-based internal dialysis solution, exposure to 5 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> reduced significantly the amplitude of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>. In spontaneously active AVN myocytes, action potential upstroke velocity was decreased by <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> exposure, consistent with the observed change in <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>. 3. By use of a Cs-based internal dialysis solution to record <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> selectively, <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> test pulses were applied from a holding potential of -40 mV to +10 mV (stimulation frequency 0.33 Hz). <span class=\"chemicals\">Propafenone</span> 5 microM reduced mean <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> density at +10 mV from -9.58 +/- 1.05 pA/pF to -4.19 +/- 0.60 pA/pF (P < 0.002). A range of <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> concentrations were applied which reduced <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> in a dose-dependent manner (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> 1.7 microM). When test pulses were applied to a range of potentials, <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> reduced <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> at each potential without significantly affecting the activation curve for this current. Thus, <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> reduced <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> conductance, without affecting the <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> activation properties of the current. 4. <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> by <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> exhibited <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span>-, use- and frequency-dependent characteristics. 5. In the presence of <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span>, the voltage-dependence of inactivation of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> was shifted 8 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction. Also, the recovery of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> from inactivation was slowed by <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span>. 6. The <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> properties of <span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> may mediate some of the <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> properties of this agent, particularly in regions of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> such as the AVN in which <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> contributes significantly to the action potential upstroke.</td>\n",

The <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> muscle cells could be divided into type I and type II cells, on the basis of morphological differences in the dissociated myocytes. FMRFamide induced a substantial <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current seen in type I cells; this inhibition was rapid, reversible and dose dependent (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 0.1 microM). FMRFamide induced an increase in the amplitude of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current in the type II <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> muscle cells, but had no effect on the T-type <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current in either type of dissociated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> muscle cell, even at concentrations much higher than those found to affect the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current. Internal dialysis of isolated type I <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> muscle cells with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate (GTPgammaS, 100 microM), a non-hydrolysable GTP <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span>, mimicked the FMRFamide inhibition of the Ca2+ current and occluded any further FMRFamide-induced inhibition. Internal dialysis of these cells with guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPbetaS, 100 microM) reduced the FMRFamide-induced inhibition of the peak Ca2+ current. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects of FMRFamide were abolished by pre-incubation of the cells with pertussis toxin (200 ng ml-1). The activation kinetics of <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> were not affected by FMRFamide application, nor by internal perfusion with GTPgammaS, and the FMRFamide-induced reduction in <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> was not relieved by large depolarising prepulses. These data indicate that FMRFamide can modulate <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>, but not ICa,T, in squid <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> muscle cells, and that the underlying G protein pathway is dissimilar to that commonly associated with transmitter modulation of <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity. The FMRFamide-modulated increase in <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> seen in the type II <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> muscle cells was not mediated by a PTX-sensitive G protein pathway.</td>\n",

(-)-<span class=\"chemicals\">Verapamil</span> shifted (+)-<span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> inhibition curves to the right in an apparently competitive fashion.

The similar <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> ratios for <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> and for <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiodepression</span> are indicative of a common locus of action for both <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> enantiomers within the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span>.</td>\n",

At present, the effect of CBG on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I Ca-L) of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes remains undefined. The aim of the present study was to characterize the effect of CBG on intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) handling and cell contractility in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. CBG was investigated by determining its influence on I Ca-L, Ca(2+) transient, and contractility in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes using the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique and video-based edge-detection and dual-excitation fluorescence photomultiplier systems. The dose of CBG (10(-8) M) decreased the maximal inhibition of CBG by 47.93%. CBG reduced I Ca-L in a concentration-dependent manner with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 4 × 10(-10) M, upshifted the current-voltage curve of I Ca-L, and shifted the activation and inactivation curves of I Ca-L leftward. Moreover, CBG diminished the amplitude of the cell shortening and Ca(2+) transients with a decrease in the time to peak (Tp) and the time to 50% of the baseline (Tr). CBG inhibited <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span>, and reduced [Ca(2+)]i and contractility in adult <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. These findings contribute to the understanding of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> efficacy of CBG.</td>\n",

Direct effects of UcnII on adult <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> have not been evaluated before. Our aim was to characterize functional effects of UcnII on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> and to elucidate the underlying signaling pathway(s) and cellular mechanisms. METHODS: <span class=\"species\">Rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> were stimulated at 0.5 Hz (22-25 degrees C). Unloaded cell shortening (FS, edge detection), [Ca(2+)](i) transients (Fluo-4), and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) currents (I(Ca), whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamping</span>) were measured. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) load was assessed by rapid application of caffeine (20 mmol/L). RESULTS: UcnII increased cell shortening and accelerated relaxation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (EC(50): 10.7 nmol/L). The <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect of UcnII was maximal at 100 nmol/L (35%+/-11% increase in FS, n=8, P<0.05). The <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> and <span class=\"effect\">lusitropic</span> actions of UcnII were largely eliminated by inhibition of CRF(2) receptors (10 nmol/L antisauvagine-30, n=5) or protein kinase A (PKA, 500 nmol/L H-89, n=5). UcnII increased [Ca(2+)](i) transient amplitude (by 63%+/-35%, n=7, P<0.05) and decreased the time constant for decay (from 800+/-63 to 218+/-27 ms, n=7, P<0.001). UcnII also increased SR Ca(2+) load (by 19%+/-7%, n=7, P<0.05) and fractional Ca(2+) release (from 57%+/-7% to 98%+/-2%, n=7, P<0.01). I(Ca) was augmented by 32.7%+/-10.0% (n=9, P<0.05) and the I(Ca)-V relationship was shifted by -15 mV during UcnII treatment. CONCLUSION: UcnII exerts positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> and <span class=\"effect\">lusitropic</span> effects in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> via CRF(2) receptor-mediated stimulation of PKA which augments I(Ca) and SR Ca(2+) load to increase SR Ca(2+) release and [Ca(2+)](i) transients.</td>\n",

The <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> basis of the altered <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> function was examined in left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes isolated from transgenic (G alpha(q)) mice. Action potential duration was significantly prolonged in G alpha(q) compared with nontransgenic (NTG) myocytes. The densities of inward rectifier K(+) currents, transient outward K(+) currents (I(to)), and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)/Ca(2+) exchange currents were reduced in G alpha(q) myocytes. Consistent with functional measurements, <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger gene expression was reduced in G alpha(q) hearts. Kinetics or sensitivity of I(to) to 4-aminopyridine was unchanged, but 4-aminopyridine prolonged the action potential more in G alpha(q) myocytes. Isoproterenol increased <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) currents (I(Ca)) in both groups, with a similar EC(50), but the maximal response in G alpha(q) myocytes was approximately 24% of that in NTG myocytes. In NTG myocytes, the maximal increase of I(Ca) with isoproterenol or forskolin was similar. In G alpha(q) myocytes, forskolin was more effective and enhanced I(Ca) up to approximately 55% of that in NTG myocytes. These results indicate that the changes in ionic currents and multiple defects in the beta-adrenergic receptor/<span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>signaling pathway contribute to altered <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> function in this model of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> hypertrophy.</td>\n",

The present study examines its <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects in isolated canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, tissues, and arterially perfused left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> wedge preparations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Transmembrane action potentials (APs) from epicardial and midmyocardial (M) regions and a pseudo-ECG were recorded simultaneously from wedge preparations. APs were also recorded from epicardial and M tissues. Whole-cell currents were recorded from epicardial and M myocytes. Ranolazine inhibited I(Kr) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>=11.5 micromol/L), late I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>), late I(Ca), peak I(Ca), and I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>-Ca) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>=5.9, 50, 296, and 91 micromol/L, respectively) and I(Ks) (17% at 30 micromol/L), but caused little or no inhibition of I(to) or I(K1). In tissues and wedge preparations, ranolazine produced a concentration-dependent prolongation of AP duration of epicardial but abbreviation of that of M cells, leading to reduction or no change in transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR). At [K+]o=4 mmol/L, 10 micromol/L ranolazine prolonged <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval by 20 ms but did not increase TDR. Extrasystolic activity and spontaneous <span class=\"effect\">torsade de pointes</span> (<span class=\"effect\">TdP</span>) were never observed, and stimulation-induced <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> could not be induced at any concentration of ranolazine, either in normal or low [K+]o. Ranolazine (5 to 20 micromol/L) suppressed early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and reduced the increase in TDR induced by the selective I(Kr) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> d-<span class=\"chemicals\">sotalol</span>. CONCLUSIONS: Ranolazine produces ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> effects similar to those observed after chronic amiodarone (reduced I(Kr), I(Ks), late I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>), and I(Ca)). The actions of ranolazine to suppress EADs and reduce TDR suggest that, in addition to its antianginal actions, the drug may possess <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> activity.</td>\n",

However, little is known about developmental changes in modulation of ICa by phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which also regulate intracellular cAMP concentration by its hydrolysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Enzymatically isolated adult and newborn (1- to 3-day-old) <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes were used to study the effects of PDE <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> on ICa measured by the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> method. 3-Isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (<span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span>), a nonselective PDE <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, increased ICa in a dose-dependent manner for both groups. The maximal effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span>, expressed as percentage increase in ICa over control levels, was greater for newborn myocytes than for adult myocytes, but the effects of <span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span> applied alone were observed only at concentrations > 10 mumol/L. The concomitant use of 0.1 mumol/L isoproterenol produced a significant potentiation of the <span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span> effect on ICa, with a significant additive effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span> in newborn myocytes even at 0.05 mumol/L <span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span>. The concomitant use of a subthreshold concentration of <span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span> (0.1 mumol/L) did not potentiate the dose dependence of adult ICa on isoproterenol but did markedly potentiate the dose dependence of newborn ICa on isoproterenol. The Emax and <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of isoproterenol in the presence of 0.1 mumol/L <span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span> on newborn ICa were 235% and 8 nmol/L, respectively, whereas the Emax and <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of isoproterenol in the absence of <span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span> on newborn ICa were 111% and 81 nmol/L, respectively. The addition of 50 mumol/L <span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span> to 10 mumol/L isoproterenol markedly increased the newborn ICa density up to a level equivalent to that reached with 200 mumol/L cAMP in the pipette (14.9 +/- 1.2 versus 13.4 +/- 0.7 pA/pF). Our data suggest that the inhibition constant (Ki) of <span class=\"chemicals\">IBMX</span> for inhibiting PDEs that participate in the regulation of ICa is much lower in newborn than in adult myocytes. Milrinone 1 mumol/L, a selective PDE III <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, increased the 0.1 mumol/L isoproterenol-stimulated ICa of adult myocytes but had no significant additive effect for the 0.1 mumol/L isoproterenol-stimulated ICa of newborn myocytes. Rolipram 1 mumol/L, a selective PDE IV <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, increased the 0.1 mumol/L isoproterenol-stimulated ICa for newborn myocytes but had no significant additive effect for the 0.1 mumol/L isoproterenol-stimulated ICa for adult myocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the most important PDE isozyme for regulation of ICa of <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> myocytes changes from PDE IV to PDE III during the postnatal period.</td>\n",

In <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, HA-7 concentration-dependently prolonged the action potential duration (APD) and decreased the maximal rate of rise of the action potential upstroke (Vmax). The action potential amplitude and resting membrane potential were also reduced, but to a smaller extent. The prolongation of APD by HA-7 was prevented by pretreating the cells with 1 mM 4-AP. 3. <span class=\"assays\">Voltage clamp</span> experiments revealed that HA-7 decreased the maximal current amplitude of I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 4.1 microM) and caused a negative shift of its steady-state inactivation curve and slowed its rate of recovery from inactivation. The <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> inhibition of I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) by HA-7 was enhanced at a higher stimulation rate. The <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (I(Ca)) was also reduced, but to a lesser degree (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 5.3 microM, maximal inhibition = 31.8%). 4. This agent also influenced the time- and <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> K currents. The prolongation of APD was associated with an inhibition of a 4-AP sensitive transient outward K current (I(to)) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 2.9 microM) and a slowly inactivating, steady-state outward current (I(SS)) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 2.5 microM). The inhibition of I(to) by HA-7 was associated with an acceleration of its time constant of inactivation. HA-7 suppressed I(to) in a time-dependent manner and caused a significant negative shift of the <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> steady-state inactivation curve but did not affect its rate of recovery from inactivation. 5. At higher concentrations, the inward rectifier K+ current (I(KI)) was also inhibited but to a less extent. Its slope conductance after 3, 10 and 30 microM HA-7 was decreased by 24+/-4%, 41+/-5% and 54+/-8%. respectively. 6. We conclude that HA-7 predominantly <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> I(to) and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> and that it also weakly <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> Ca2+ and I(KI) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. These changes alter the <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> properties of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> and terminate the ischaemia reperfusion induced <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmia</span>. The significant I(to) inhibition and minimal I(Ca) suppression may afford an opportunity to develop an effective <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> agent linked with positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span>.</td>\n",

Two voltage-gated Ca2+ subtypes (Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.2) have been cloned for the pore-forming alpha(1)-subunit of the T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> muscle, but their differential roles remain to be clarified. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relative contribution of the two subtypes in the normal development of <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> hearts. A whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> was used to record ionic currents from <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes isolated from mice of early (E9.5) and late embryonic days (E18) and from adult 10-wk-old mice. Large T-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca,T)) was observed at both E9.5 and E18, displaying similar voltage-dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation. The current was inhibited by Ni2+ at relatively low concentrations (IC(50) 26-31 microM). I(Ca,T) was undetectable in adult myocytes. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that Ca(v)3.2 mRNA is the predominant subtype encoding T-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> at both E9.5 and E18. Ca(v)3.1 mRNA increased from E9.5 to E18, but remained low compared with Ca(v)3.2 mRNA during the whole embryonic period. In the adulthood, in contrast, Ca(v)3.1 mRNA is greater than Ca(v)3.2 mRNA.

In the present study, in order to bring more direct evidence, purified PMCA from <span class=\"species\">human</span> red blood cells (RBC) was reconstituted into giant azolectin liposomes amenable to the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. Purified RBC PMCA was used because it is available pure in larger quantity than <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> PMCA. The presence of B-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> was first investigated in native membranes of <span class=\"species\">human</span> RBC. They were detected and share the characteristics of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes. They spontaneously appeared in scarce short bursts of activity, they were activated by chlorpromazine (CPZ) with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 149 mmole/l or 1 mmole/l vanadate, and then switched off by 10 mmole/l eosin or dose-dependently <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by 1-5 mmole/l ATP. Independent of membrane potential, the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> gating exhibited complex patterns of many conductance levels, with three most often observed conductance levels of 22, 47 and 80 pS. The activation by vanadate suggests that these <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> could play a role in the influx of extracellular Ca2+ involved in the vanadate-induced Gardos effect. In PMCA-reconstituted proteoliposomes, nearly half of the ATPase activity was retained and clear \"<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>-like\" openings of Ba2+- or Ca2+-conducting <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were detected. <span class=\"calcium\">Channel</span> activity could be spontaneously present, lasting the patch lifetime or, when previously quiescent, activity could be induced by application of 50 mmole/l CPZ only in presence of 25 U/ml calmodulin (CaM), or by application of 1 mmole/l vanadate alone. Eosin (10 mmole/l) and ATP (5 mmole/l) significantly reduced spontaneous activity. <span class=\"calcium\">Channel</span> gating characteristics were similar to those of RBC, with main conductance levels of 21, 40 and 72 pS. The lack of direct activation by CPZ alone might be attributed to a purification-induced modification or absence of unidentified regulatory component(s) of PMCA. Despite a few differences in results between RBC and reincorporated PMCA, most probably attributable to the decrease in ATPase activity following the procedure of reincorporation, the present experimental conditions appear to reveal a <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>-mode of the PMCA that shares many similarities with the B-type <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span>.</td>\n",

The <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects of S-<span class=\"chemicals\">oxybutynin</span>, a single-enantiomer drug under evaluation for the management of urinary incontinence, have been investigated and compared with those of <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span>, an incontinence agent withdrawn following reports of <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> lengthening and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> tachyarrhythmia. Membrane currents were recorded from whole-cell configured <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> and <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, and action potentials were recorded from <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> and <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles. 2. <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I:(Ca,L)), rapidly-activating K(+) current (I:(Kr)) and slowly-activating K(+) current (I:(Ks)) were unaffected by submicromolar S-<span class=\"chemicals\">oxybutynin</span> and inhibited by higher concentrations; IC(50) values were 17.8 microM for I:(Ca,L), 12 microM for I:(Kr), and 41 microM for I:(Ks). <span class=\"chemicals\">Terodiline</span> IC(50) values were somewhat lower for I:(Ca,L) (15.2 microM) and I:(Ks) (30 microM), but 24 fold lower in the case of I:(Kr) (0.5 microM). 3. The durations of action potentials in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> and <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles driven at 1 Hz were unaffected or moderately shortened by 0.1 - 100 microM S-<span class=\"chemicals\">oxybutynin</span>, but lengthened by <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span>. <span class=\"chemicals\">Terodiline</span> (< or =10 microM) also depressed maximal upstroke velocity. 4. The action potential plateau shortened by an average of 23% when control <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles were driven at 0.4 Hz instead of 1 Hz. Plateau shortening was significantly smaller in the presence of drugs (30 microM S-<span class=\"chemicals\">oxybutynin</span>, 3 and 30 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span>), suggesting that they suppress the transient outward current (I:(to)) involved in rate-dependent shortening. In experiments on <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, 3 and 30 microM S-<span class=\"chemicals\">oxybutynin</span> inhibited I:(to) by 9+/-2% and 35+/-3%, respectively, whereas 3 and 30 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span> inhibited the current by 31+/-3% and 87+/-3%, respectively. 5. The results indicate that S-<span class=\"chemicals\">oxybutynin</span> has relatively weak non-specific effects on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, and that clinically relevant submicromolar concentrations are unlikely to have <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span>-like proarrhythmic actions on the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span>.</td>\n",

The whole-cell configuration of the gigaohm seal <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> and an internal perfusion technique were used to study the effects of adenosine on the basal <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (ICa) in enzymatically isolated right <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes of ferrets. Basal <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> ICa was isolated by using a <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)- and K(+)-free saline (replacement by N-methyl-D-glucamine+, Cs+ and TEA+, respectively). All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22-24 degrees C). 2. Basal ICa was markedly reduced during exposure to adenosine in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-<span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of 0.3 microM and maximum inhibition of 35%. This effect was completely abolished by 50 nM 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (CPDPX), a specific A1 adenosine receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> with an inhibition constant, Ki = 0.48 nM. Inhibition was also observed in the presence of 1 microM atropine. 3. Adenosine decreased basal ICa by decreasing the peak amplitude of ICa without significantly altering (i) the voltage dependence of the current-voltage relationship, (ii) the apparent reversal potential, (iii) the voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation, (iv) the kinetics of inactivation at 0 mV, and (v) the kinetics of recovery from inactivation at -70 mV. 4. Pretreatment of cells with 0.4 microns/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) for 4 h at 37 degrees C produced greater than 90% ADP ribosylation of PTX-sensitive G proteins. PTX pretreatment significantly attenuated the adenosine-mediated decrease in ICa (35% in control; 4.6% after PTX pretreatment). 5. The peptide <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> (PKI) of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A at a concentration of 2 microM neither inhibited basal ICa nor attenuated the effects of adenosine on basal ICa. However, PKI decreased the stimulatory effects of 100 microM cAMP on ICa. 6. Increasing intracellular cAMP to a supra-saturable level by using 10 mM cAMP and 100 microM papaverine did not prevent adenosine from inhibiting ICa. 7. Consistent with the reduction of basal ICa, adenosine produced an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on the action potential under basal conditions, i.e. hyperpolarization of the plateau phase and marked shortening of action potential duration. These effects were concentration dependent. 8. These results demonstrate a reduction of the basal <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> ICa by adenosine in ferret <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span>. This reduction is not mediated by modification of <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> properties of macroscopic ICa. The shortening of action potentials may be explained in part by the reduction in ICa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</td>\n",

The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) is known to plays a major role in the regulation of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span>, respiratory, gustatory, hepatic and swallowing functions. <span class=\"effect\">Voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> (VDCCs) serve as crucial mediators of membrane excitability and Ca(2+)-dependent functions such as neurotransmitter release, enzyme activity and gene expression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of GAL on VDCCs currents (ICa) carried by Ba2+ (IBa) in the NTS using <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> recording methods. An application of M617 (GalR1 specific agonist), AR-M961 (GAL receptor GalR 1/2 agonist) and GAL caused inhibition of N- and P/Q-types I(Ba). M617, GAL, and AR-M961 caused inhibition of I(Ba) in a concentration-dependent manner, with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50s</span> of 678 nM, 325 nM and 573 nM, respectively. This inhibition was relieved, albeit incompletely, by a depolarizing prepulse. Pretreatment with M35 (GalR non-specific <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>) attenuated the M617-induced inhibition of I(Ba). Intracellular dialysis of the Galpha(i)-protein antibody also attenuated the Gal-induced inhibition of IBa. These results indicate that GAL inhibits N- and P/Q-types VDCCs via Galpha(i)-protein betagamma subunits mediated by GalR1 in NTS.</td>\n",

The present study on <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes was undertaken to gain insight into the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioactive</span> properties of the drug. Clinically relevant concentrations (<10 microM) of <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span> lengthened the action potential duration by up to 12%; higher concentrations shortened the duration in a concentration-dependent manner. The drug depressed maximal upstroke velocity in a <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> manner; the IC(50) value was near 150 microM in muscles driven at 1 Hz, 60 microM at 3 Hz, 38 microM at 5 Hz, and 3 microM at 1 Hz in muscles depolarized with 14 mM K(+). Submicromolar <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span> frequently had a small positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect, whereas micromolar concentrations depressed force in a frequency-dependent manner. <span class=\"assays\">Voltage-clamp</span> results on myocytes indicate that <span class=\"chemicals\">terodiline</span> inhibits three membrane currents that govern repolarization: 1) E4031-sensitive, rapidly activating K(+) current with an IC(50) value near 0.7 microM as previously reported; 2) slowly activating, delayed-rectifier K(+) current with an IC(50) value of 26 microM; and 3) <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current with an IC(50) value of 12 microM. These findings are correlated with the changes in action potential configuration and developed tension and discussed in relation to the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiotoxic</span> effects of the drug.</td>\n",

One strategy is to differentiate these bone marrow stem cells in vitro into <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> prior to implantation. In this context ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> can be important functional markers of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> differentiation. At present there is little information about the <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> behaviour of the undifferentiated hMSC. We therefore investigated mRNA expression of 26 ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> subunits using semiquantitative RT-PCR and recorded transmembrane ion currents with the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> technique. Bone marrow hMSC were obtained from healthy donors. The cells revealed a distinct pattern of ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> mRNA with high expression levels for some <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> subunits (e.g. Kv4.2, Kv4.3, MaxiK, HCN2, and alpha1C of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span>). Outward currents were recorded in almost all cells. The most abundant outward current rapidly activated at potentials positive to +20 mV. This current was identified as a large-conductance voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current, conducted by MaxiK <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, due to its high sensitivity to tetraethylammonium (IC(50)= 340 microm) and its inhibition by 100 nm iberiotoxin. A large fraction of cells also demonstrated a more slowly activating current at potentials positive to -30 mV. This current was selectively inhibited by clofilium (IC(50)= 0.8 microm). Ba(2+) inward currents, stimulated by 1 microm BayK 8644 were found in a few cells, indicating the expression of functional <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channels</span>. Other inward currents such as <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> currents or inward rectifier currents were absent. We conclude that undifferentiated hMSC express a distinct pattern of ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> mRNA and functional ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> that might contribute to physiological cell function.</td>\n",

At low frequencies (less than 0.03 Hz) and negative holding potentials (-90 mV or more), <span class=\"chemicals\">nitrendipine</span> increased the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca currents</span> in a dose-dependent manner. The dose-response curve was best fitted by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm model which was the sum of two independent one-to-one drug-receptor sites with median effective doses (<span class=\"IC50s\">ED50S</span>) of 1.0 X 10(-9) M and 1.4 X 10(-6) M respectively. When the membrane potential was held at -30 mV or less, <span class=\"chemicals\">nitrendipine</span> inhibited the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca currents</span>, also in a dose-dependent manner. The dose-response curve was fitted by a single <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site model having a median <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>) of 1.5 X 10(-9) M. At holding potentials between -70 and -40 mV, <span class=\"chemicals\">nitrendipine</span> produced mixed effects on <span class=\"calcium\">Ca currents</span>; an increase occurred initially and this was followed by a decrease. When rundown was excluded, Bay K8644 showed only stimulatory effects on the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca currents</span> between holding potentials of -120 and -30 mV. When the test potential was zero or +10 mV the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca currents</span> reached peak values and the dose-response curve was best fitted by a single <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site model having an <span class=\"IC50s\">ED50</span> of 3 X 10(-8) M. When the effects were measured at negative test potentials of -30 to -10 mV, the curve was best fitted by a two-site model with <span class=\"IC50s\">ED50S</span> of 3 X 10(-9) and 9 X 10(-7) M. At the single <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channel</span> level the stimulatory effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">nitrendipine</span> was due to an increased probability that a <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channel</span> which had opened once would reopen, a reduction in records without activity and an increase in the mean open time. There were no changes in unit conductance. <span class=\"other_terms\">Inhibitory</span> effects were due to a large increase in nulls. At lower concentrations the main effect of Bay K8644 was an increase in the probability of opening. At doses above 10(-6) M, a pronounced increase in the open time was observed. The effects we observed are attributed to at least two sites for DHP related to <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channels</span>; one with high <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> and one with a lower <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span>. The low <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> site mediates a stimulatory effect due to greatly prolonged openings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</td>\n",

Despite a range of assays performed to assess <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> effects on the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval, <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> prolongation remains a major cause of attrition during <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> development. In silico assays could alleviate such problems. In this study we evaluated an in silico method of predicting the results of a <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> left-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> wedge assay. METHODS: Concentration-effect data were acquired from either: the high-throughput <span class=\"assays\">IonWorks</span>/FLIPR; the medium-throughput <span class=\"assays\">PatchXpress</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> assays; or QSAR, a statistical <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value prediction model, for hERG, fast <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span>, <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> and KCNQ1/minK <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Drug <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> was incorporated into a mathematical differential equation model of <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocyte <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiology</span> through modification of the maximal conductance of each <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> by a factor dependent on the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value, Hill coefficient and concentration of each <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> tested. Simulations were performed and agreement with experimental results, based upon input data from the different assays, was evaluated. RESULTS: The assay was found to be 78% accurate, 72% sensitive and 81% specific when predicting <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> prolongation (>10%) using <span class=\"assays\">PatchXpress</span> assay data (77 <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span>). Similar levels of predictivity were demonstrated using <span class=\"assays\">IonWorks</span>/FLIPR data (121 <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span>) with 78% accuracy, 73% sensitivity and 80% specificity. <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> shortening (<-10%) was predicted with 77% accuracy, 33% sensitivity and 90% specificity using <span class=\"assays\">PatchXpress</span> data and 71% accuracy, 42% sensitivity and 81% specificity using <span class=\"assays\">IonWorks</span>/FLIPR data. Strong quantitative agreement between simulation and experimental results was also evident. DISCUSSION: The in silico action potential assay demonstrates good predictive ability, and is suitable for very high-throughput use in early drug development. Adoption of such an assay into <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> safety assessment, integrating ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> data from routine screens to infer results of animal-based tests, could provide a cost- and time-effective <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> safety screen.</td>\n",

Harms (AS), a traditional herbal medicine, has been widely used to treat ischemic <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> disease. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms of its benefits to <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> function remain unclear. The present study examined the effects of total flavones from AS (TFAS) on <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+) channel </span>currents (ICa-L ) using the whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique and on intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> ([Ca(2+) ]i ) handling and cell contractility in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes with the aid of a video-based edge-detection system. Exposure to TFAS resulted in a concentration- and <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of ICa-L , with the half-maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> ) of 283.12 µg/mL and the maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of 36.49 ± 1.95%. Moreover, TFAS not only increased the maximum current in the current-voltage relationship but also shifted the activation and inactivation curves of ICa-L toward the hyperpolarizing direction. Meanwhile, TFAS significantly reduced amplitudes of myocyte shortening and [Ca(2+) ]i with an increase in the time to 10% of the peak (Tp) and a decrease in the time to 10% of the baseline (Tr). Thus, the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> effects of TFAS may be attributed mainly to the attenuation of [Ca(2+) ]i through the direct inhibition of ICa-L in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes and consequent negative effect on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> contractility.</td>\n",

No changes in <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> of either <span class=\"chem\">ligand</span> were observed. Responses of isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles from propylthiouracil-treated animals accorded with changes seen in the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> studies. The geometric mean <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of isoproterenol increased from 9.5 x 10(-9) mol/l to 5.5 x 10(-8) mol/l, and the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> decreased from 3.16 x 10(-3) mol/l to 1.36 x 10(-3) mol/l; moreover, the responsiveness to the <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> activator Bay K 8644 was increased. The corresponding responses in thyroxine-treated animals could not be examined because of prominent <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmic</span> activity. As with <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles the sensitivity of left atria to isoproterenol was decreased after treatment with propylthiouracil, with geometric mean <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values increasing from 3.21 x 10(-9) mol/l to 89.4 x 10(-9) mol/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>\n",

In control conditions, with Ba2+ or Ca2+ as charge carrier, single-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity spontaneously appeared in irregular bursts separated by quiescent periods of 2-17 min, in nearly 25% of tested patches. <span class=\"calcium\">Channel</span> activity was recorded at steady-state applied membrane potentials including the entire range of physiological values, and displayed no \"rundown\" in excised patches. During activity, a variety of kinetic behaviors could be observed with more or less complex gating patterns. This type of <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity was triggered or markedly increased when chlorpromazine (CPZ 20 or 50 microM) was applied to internal face of inside-out patches, with a proportion of active patches of approximately 25%. CPZ-activated <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> were potential-independent in the physiological range of membrane potential. In 96 mM Ba2+ solution, three conductance levels: 23, 42 and 85 pS were routinely observed in the same excised membrane patch, sometimes combining to give a larger level.

(1995) in membrane of <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, increasing free-radicals level and metabolic poisoning readily enhanced B-type <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. Application of H2O2 (from 0.1-10 mM) in cell-attached mode induced an activation of Ba2+ permeable <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity in a dose-dependent manner, with an estimated <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 9.7 mM. In the same type of experiments, 10 mM deoxyglucose also induced similar Ba2+ permeable <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity. When 500 microM CPZ were applied to myocytes studied in the whole-cell configuration and maintained at a holding potential of -80 mV in the presence of 5 mM external Ca2+, a noticeable inward current could be observed. The mean CPZ-activated current density determined from seven myocytes was 0.63 pA/pF.</td>\n",

However, the therapeutic potential of ECG on the treatment of <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmia</span> remains unknown. We investigated the direct actions of ECG on the modulation of ion currents and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cell excitability in the primary culture of neonatal <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocyte (NRVM), which is considered a hypertrophic model for analysis of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>. By using the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> configurations, we found ECG enhanced the slowly inactivating component of voltage-gated <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) currents (I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>)) in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1-100 μM) with an EC(50) value of 3.8 μM. ECG not only shifted the current-voltage relationship of peak I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) to the hyperpolarizing direction but also accelerated I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) recovery kinetics. Working at a concentration level of I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) enhancement, ECG has no notable effect on voltage-gated K(+) currents and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) currents. With culture time increment, the firing rate of spontaneous action potential (sAP) in NRVMs was gradually decreased until spontaneous early after-depolarization (EAD) was observed after about one week culture. ECG increased the firing rate of normal sAP about two-fold without waveform alteration. Interestingly, the <span class=\"effect\">bradycardia</span>-dependent EAD could be significantly restored by ECG in fast firing rate to normal sAP waveform. The expression of dominant <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> subunit, Nav1.5, was consistently detected throughout the culture periods. Our results reveal how ECG, the novel I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) agonist, may act as a promising candidate in clinical applications on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>.</td>\n",

However, its <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> actions on <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span> are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Action potentials (APs) and ion currents were recorded in right <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> trabeculae and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> from patients in sinus rhythm (SR) and chronic AF. Vernakalant prolonged early repolarization in SR and AF, but late only in AF. AP amplitude (APA) and dV/dtmax were reduced in a concentration- and frequency-dependent manner with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> < 10 µM at >3 Hz. Effective refractory period was increased more than action potential duration (APD) in SR and AF. INa was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50s</span> of 95 and 84 µM for SR and AF, respectively (0.5 Hz). Vernakalant did not reduce outward potassium currents compared with time-matched controls. However, area under the current-time curve was reduced due to acceleration of current decline with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50s</span> of 19 and 12 µM for SR and AF, respectively. Vernakalant had less effect on APD than the IKr <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span>, <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> IK,ACh, and had a small <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on IK1 at 30 µM. <span class=\"calcium\">L-Type</span> Ca(2+) currents (SR) were reduced with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 84 µM. CONCLUSION: Rate-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> represents the main <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> mechanism of vernakalant in the fibrillating <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>. Open <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of early transient outward currents and IK,ACh could also contribute.</td>\n",

AIM OF THE STUDY: Evaluate the aqueous fraction (AqF) effect on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> contractility and investigate its mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AqF effect on the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> contractility was studied on isolated electrically driven <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> left atria. Atropine and tetraethylammonium (TEA) were employed to investigate whether potassium contributes for the <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> mechanism of the AqF. The role of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> in this effect was also studied. This was done by analysing the AqF effect on the Bowditch's phenomenon, as well as by studying whether it could interfere with the concentration-effect curve for CaCl(2), isoproterenol, and BAY K8644. Mice isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> were submitted to a whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique in order to evaluate whether the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current participates on the AqF effect. Furthermore, the intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> transient was studied by confocal fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: AqF depressed the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> contractile force. It was the most potent fraction from C. spiralis leaf (EC(50)=305 ± 41 mg/l) (crude extract: EC(50)=712 ± 41; ethyl acetate: EC(50)=788 ± 121; chloroform: EC(50)=8,948 ± 1,346 mg/l). <span class=\"sodium\">Sodium</span> and potassium content in the AqF was 0.15 mM and 1.91 mM, respectively. Phytochemical analysis revealed phenols, tannins, flavones, xanthones, flavonoids, flavonols, flavononols, flavonones, and saponins. Experiments with atropine and TEA showed that potassium does not participate of the <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> mechanism of AqF. However, this fraction decreased the force overshoot characteristic of the Bowditch's phenomenon, and shifted the concentration-response curve for CaCl(2) (EC(50) from 1.12 ± 0.07 to 7.23 ± 0.47 mM) indicating that <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents participate on its mechanism of action. Results obtained with isoproterenol (1-1,000 pM) and BAY K8644 (5-2000nM) showed that AqF abolished the <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect of these substances. On <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, 48mg/l AqF reduced (∼23%) the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current density from -6.3 ± 0.3 to -4.9 ± 0.2 A/F (n=5 cells, p<0.05) and reduced the intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> transient (∼20%, 4.7 ± 1.2 a.u., n=42 cells to 3.7 ± 1.00 a.u., n=35 cells, p<0.05). However, the decay time of the fluorescence was not changed (control: 860 ± 32 ms, n=42 cells; AqF: 876 ± 26 ms, n=35 cells, p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The AqF of C. spiralis leaf depresses <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> contractility by reducing the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current and by decreasing the intracellular <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> transient. Despite the lack of data on the therapeutic dose of AqF used in folk medicine, our results support, at least in part, the traditional use of this plant to treat <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> disorders.</td>\n",

METHODS: <span class=\"species\">Rabbit</span> SAN pacemaker cells were studied using the perforated <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> technique in voltage-, AP- and current-clamp modes. RESULTS: <span class=\"assays\">Voltage-clamp</span> findings. <span class=\"other_terms\">Block</span> of i(Ks) by 293b is dose-dependent, with an IC(50) (half <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>) in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> SAN cells of 1.35 microM and an IC(80) (sub-maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>) of 5 microM. Sub-maximal concentrations of 293b have no significant effects on long-lasting and transient inward <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> currents, i(Ca,L) and i(Ca,T), inward hyperpolarization activated current, i(f), and transient outward current, i(to). AP-clamp experiments. The 293b-sensitive current activates near the peak of the SAN pacemaker action potential, reaches a mean maximal current density of 1.0+/-0.3 pA/pF (n=8, cell capacitances 27 to 62 pF, mean 35+/-4.0 pF) during late repolarization, and inactivates towards the end of repolarization. Additionally, in two smaller cells (cell capacitances 15 and 23 pF), no discernible 293b-sensitive current component was detected. Current-clamp data. In spontaneously beating SAN cells under control conditions, sub-maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of i(Ks) by 5 microM 293b has negligible effects on action potential characteristics and does not change average cycle length (n=11). In contrast, after pre-treatment with 10 nM isoprenaline to mimic beta-adrenergic stimulation, cells showed a 293b-induced depolarization of maximum diastolic potential by 2.2+/-1%, a decrease in diastolic depolarization rate by 9.9+/-4%, and a slowing of late action potential repolarization by 28.7+/-10.2%, resulting in a prolongation of spontaneous cycle length by 9.8+/-3.0% (P<0.05, n=10; for all parameters). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> SAN: (i) i(Ks) is activated during the normal pacemaker AP; (ii) the contribution of i(Ks) to beating rate is small under control conditions; and (iii) i(Ks) contributes significantly to spontaneous pacemaker rate during beta-adrenergic stimulation.</td>\n",

Ketamine is widely used for the induction of anaesthesia in high-risk patients with <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> instability or severe hypovolaemia. However, the ionic mechanisms involved in the effects of ketamine at therapeutically relevant concentrations in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes are unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of ketamine on <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ (I(Ca)), transient outward K+ (I(to)), ultra-rapid delayed rectifier K+ (I(Kur)) and inward rectifier potassium (I(K1)) currents, as well as on action potentials, in <span class=\"species\">human</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. 2. <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">Atrial</span> myocytes were isolated enzymatically from specimens of <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> appendage obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The action potential and membrane currents were recorded in both current- and <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> modes using the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. 3. Ketamine inhibited I(Ca) with an IC(50) of 1.8 micromol/L. In addition, 10 micromol/L ketamine decreased the I(Ca) peak current at +10 mV from 5.1 +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.4 pA/pF (P < 0.01), but did not change the threshold potential, peak current potential and reverse potential. 4. Ketamine had no effect on I(to), I(Kur) or I(K1), but it reversibly shortened the duration of the action potential in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. 5. In conclusion, ketamine, at a clinically relevant concentration, shortens the action potential duration of the <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes, probably by inhibiting I(Ca).</td>\n",

Transient outward currents have been reported in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> tissue of some animals but are small or absent in others. This study was conducted to investigate whether a transient outward current exists in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span> and to characterize its basic <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> properties. Currents were recorded from enzymatically isolated <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes obtained from explanted hearts of 22 patients with terminal <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> failure. In almost all cells studied, a transient outward current could be recorded on depolarization to between -20 and +80 mV. The size of the transient outward current was usually large enough to mask the Ca2+ current. It could be recorded under conditions in which Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ transients were suppressed. Basic current characteristics were similar to transient outward currents observed in other species. Inactivation of the transient outward current was monoexponential, with a time constant of 54.8 +/- 3.7 milliseconds at +40 mV. Half-maximal activation occurred at 16.7 +/- 1.6 mV; half-maximal steady-state inactivation occurred at -34.5 +/- 2.3 mV. Frequency-dependent reduction of peak transient outward current was 29.8 +/- 1.4% at 2 Hz compared with resting conditions. Recovery from inactivation was <span class=\"effect\">voltage dependent</span> and had a biexponential time course; the faster time constant (41.0 +/- 6.5 milliseconds at -80 mV) accounted for 86.0 +/- 5.2% of total current. The transient outward current was sensitive to 4-aminopyridine (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>, 1.15 mM). These results indicate that a large Ca(2+)-independent transient outward K+ current is present in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes that might be regulated by physiological or pathological events and is a potential site for pharmacological intervention.</td>\n",

We previously suggested that the prolongation of APD could be due to KT inhibition of the fast component of the delayed rectifier current (IKr) in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> myocytes. However, in other tissue such as <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>, Purkinje fibers, epicardial cells, and <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, the transient outward potassium current (Ito) is one of the major repolarizing currents. We investigated the possibility that KT could also increase APD by <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> Ito. Action potentials and membrane currents were recorded from <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes known to have a large Ito by using whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques. We found that KT (50 mumol/L) significantly prolonged APD at 50% repolarization by 218% (P < .05) and APD at 90% repolarization by 256% (P < .05) with no significant effect on other action potential parameters. Time-dependent Ito and sustained current (ISus) were measured in the presence of 400 nmol/L <span class=\"chemicals\">nisoldipine</span> during depolarizing pulses to 40 mV from a holding potential of -100 mV every 10 seconds. KT resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of charge area of Ito evaluated by integration with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 8.3 mumol/L. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of KT (10 mumol/L) was seen at voltages from 0 to 80 mV without any shift of the current-voltage relation of peak Ito. KT did not significantly change activation, inactivation, and reactivating curves of Ito. Kinetic analysis of Ito showed a biexponential fit of inactivation in 80.5% of total tracings studied at voltages between -30 and 80 mV (n = 149, R = .99 +/- .01). The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of KT was more prominent on charge areas of the slow component (Qs) than the fast component (Qf) of Ito (Qf = 33.2 +/- 6.2 s.pA and Qs = 235.5 +/- 7.4 s.pA for the control condition; 12.4 +/- 4.3 and 59.6 +/- 17 s.pA for KT at 40 mV; n = 4). The <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> association (k) and dissociation (l) constants at 40 mV were 9.0 +/- 0.9x10(6) M-1.s-1 and 86.6 +/- 0.3 s-1, respectively. KT also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> ISus in a dose-dependent manner with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 11.2 mumol/L and had no significant effect on both the inward rectifier potassium current and the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</td>\n",

The aims of this study were to examine the effects of 5-HT on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (ICaL) action potential duration (APD), the effective refractory period (ERP) and <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmic</span> activity in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells, and to assess the effects of prior treatment with beta-adrenoceptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span>. Isolated myocytes, from the right <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> appendage of 27 consenting patients undergoing <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> surgery who were in sinus rhythm, were studied using the whole-cell perforated <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique at 37 degrees C. 5-HT (1 nm-10 microm) caused a concentration-dependent increase in ICaL, which was potentiated in cells from beta-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> (maximum response to 5-HT, Emax=299+/-12% increase above control) compared to non-beta-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> patients (Emax=220+/-6%, P<0.05), but with no change in either the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> (log <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>: -7.09+/-0.07 vs -7.26+/-0.06) or Hill coefficient (nH: 1.5+/-0.6 vs 1.5+/-0.3) of the 5-HT concentration-response curve. 5-HT (10 microm) produced a greater increase in the APD at 50% repolarisation (APD50) in cells from beta-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> patients (of 37+/-10 ms, i.e. 589+/-197%) vs non-beta-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> patients (of 10+/-4 ms, i.e. 157+/-54%; P<0.05). Both the APD90 and the ERP were unaffected by 5-HT. <span class=\"effect\">Arrhythmic</span> activity was observed in response to 5-HT in five of 17 cells (29%) studied from beta-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span>, compared to zero of 16 cells from the non-beta-<span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> patients (P<0.05). In summary, the 5-HT-induced increase in <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current was associated with a prolonged early plateau phase of repolarisation, but not late repolarisation or refractoriness, and the enhancement of these effects by chronic beta-adrenoceptor <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> was associated with <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmic</span> potential.</td>\n",

Here, in experiments on isolated SANCs, using confocal microscopy combined with a <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> technique, we show that ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release during the DD produces a localized subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) increase that spreads in a wavelike manner by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release and produces an inward current via the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX). Ryanodine, a <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>, in a dose-dependent manner reduces the SANC beating rate with an IC(50) of 2.6 micromol/L and abolishes the local Ca(2+) transients that precede the AP upstroke. In <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamped</span> cells in which the DD was simulated by voltage ramp, 3 micromol/L ryanodine decreased an inward current during the voltage ramp by 1.6+/-0.3 pA/pF (SEM, n=4) leaving the peak of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current unchanged. Likewise, acute <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of the NCX (via rapid substitution of bath <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) by Li(+)) abolished SANC beating and reduced the inward current to a similar extent (1.7+/-0.4 pA/pF, n=4), as did ryanodine. Thus, in addition to activation/inactivation of multiple ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, Ca(2+) activation of the NCX, because of localized sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release, is a critical element in a chain of molecular interactions that permits the heartbeat to occur and determines its beating rate.</td>\n",

Intracellular mechanisms of the muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) response were investigated in pyramidal neurones freshly dissociated from the <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hippocampal CA1 region. Current recordings were made in the whole-cell mode using the nystatin 'perforated'-patch technique, by which the muscarinic ACh response can be continuously recorded without so-called 'run-down' phenomenon. The amount of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was fluorometrically measured using fura-2. 2. In current clamp conditions, ACh induced a transient hyperpolarization accompanied by a decrease in membrane input resistance. 3. Under <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> conditions at a holding potential (Vh) of -40 mV, ACh induced two types of muscarinic currents observed either alone or together: a transient outward current and a slowly activating sustained inward current. 4. The ACh-induced transient outward current reversed the direction at K+ equilibrium potential (EK), and the reversal potential (EACh) shifted 56.7 mV for a tenfold change of extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o). 5. The ACh-induced transient outward current increased in a sigmoidal fashion with increase in ACh concentration, where the half-maximal concentration (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>) and the Hill coefficient (n) were 8 x 10(-7) M and 1.9, respectively. Both muscarine and carbamylcholine mimicked the ACh response, but neither McN-A-343 (M1 agonist) nor oxotremorine (<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> M2 agonist) induced any current. 6. Muscarinic <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> reversibly <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the ACh response in a concentration-dependent manner. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> was in the order of atropine > pirenzepine > AF-DX-116. 7. The ACh-induced transient outward current was never recorded when [Ca2+]i was chelated by the acetoxymethyl ester form of 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA AM). On the other hand, in Ca(2+)-free external solution containing 2 mM EGTA and 10 mM Mg2+, the ACh response was elicited by the first application and successive ACh applications did not induce any response. Fura-2 imaging showed that [Ca2+]i was increased when ACh was added to the external medium with or without Ca2+, though in Ca(2+)-free medium only the first application of ACh increased the [Ca2+]i. 8. The ACh response was not affected by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) but the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of ACh on the high-threshold <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> was abolished completely. 9. Pretreatment with Li+ enhanced the amplitude of the transient outward current and the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by ACh. 10. The calmodulin <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonists</span> W-7, chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine reversibly inhibited the ACh response in a concentration-dependent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</td>\n",

Interpretation of their effects on cellular and electrocardiogram (ECG)-based biomarkers for risk stratification is challenging. As pharmaceutical <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> often exhibit multiple ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> effects, our goal is to investigate the simultaneous effect of ICaL and IKr <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> on <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiology</span> from ionic to ECG level. METHODS AND RESULTS: Simulations are conducted using a <span class=\"species\">human</span> body torso bidomain model, which includes realistic representation of <span class=\"species\">human</span> membrane kinetics, anatomy, and fibre orientation. A simple <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> pore model is incorporated to simulate drug-induced ICaL and IKr <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span>, for drug dose = 0, <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>, 2× <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>, 10× <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>, and 30× <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>. Drug effects on <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> activity are quantified for different degrees and combinations of ICaL and IKr <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> from the ionic to the body surface ECG level. Electrocardiogram simulations show that ICaL <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> results in shortening of the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval, ST elevation, and reduced T-wave amplitude, caused by reduction in action potential duration and action potential amplitude during the plateau phase, and in repolarization times. In contrast, IKr <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> results in <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> prolongation and reduced T-wave amplitude. When ICaL and IKr <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> are combined, the degree of ICaL <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> strongly determines <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval whereas the effect of IKr <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> is more pronounced on the T-wave amplitude. CONCLUSION: Our simulation study provides new insights into the combined effect of ICaL and IKr <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> on <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> activity using a multiscale computational <span class=\"species\">human</span> torso model.</td>\n",

The present experiments were designed to study the positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect of DOF on <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricle</span> and explore its possible mechanism(s). METHODS: Hearts from male Wistar rats (260-320 g) were divided into five groups and perfused in Langendorff mode. <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">Ventricular</span> myocytes were enzymatically isolated from male Wistar rats. Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamping</span> technique was used to test the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-Ca(2+) exchange (NCE) current (I(NCX)); <span class=\"calcium\">Calcium</span> transients and cell shortening provoked by field stimulation or using <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current command waveform were observed synchronously with an ionic imaging system. RESULTS: DOF (0.03-1.0 microM) increased left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> function in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hearts in a concentration-dependent manner. DOF (0.03-1.0 microM) also concentration-dependently increased both inward and outward I (NCX) in isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells. The EC(50) values of DOF were 0.149 microM for the inward I(NCX) and 0.249 microM for outward I(NCX), respectively. DOF 0.2 microM significantly enhanced Ca(2+) transient and cell shortening in single <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes driven by field electric stimulation. When the <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> system was connected to the ionic imaging system, Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)), Ca(2+) transient and cell shortening amplitude in a same cell were recorded synchronously. Application of DOF 0.2 microM had no effect on I(Ca), but significantly increased Ca(2+) transient and cell shortening. NCX <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> KB-R7943 0.6 microM significantly depressed the effects of DOF on Ca(2+) transient and cell shortening. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that DOF enhanced contractility of <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. The enhancement of NCE may be involved in the positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> action of DOF.</td>\n",

However, there have been no pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> in these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> were determined in 32 patients with <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> fibrillation or <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> flutter (mean +/- SD age, 66 +/- 7 years; mean baseline <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate, 131 +/- 10 beats per minute) after 20 mg or 20 mg followed by 25-mg bolus doses and a 10 and 15 mg/hr infusion for 24 hours. After the 10 and 15 mg/hr infusions of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>, mean +/- SD elimination half-life was 6.8 +/- 1.8 and 6.9 +/- 1.5 hours, volume of distribution was 411 +/- 151.8 and 299 +/- 70.8 I, and systemic clearance was 42 +/- 12.4 and 31 +/- 8.3 l/hr, respectively. Percentages of the plasma concentrations of the principal metabolites desacetyldiltiazem and N-desmethyldiltiazem to <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> were < 15% and < 10%, respectively. Thirty of 32 patients maintained response throughout the 24-hour infusion of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span>. Using a sigmoidal Emax pharmacodynamic model, a strong relation (mean +/- SD r2, 0.78 +/- 0.2) was observed between plasma <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> concentration and percent <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate reduction. Mean +/- SD Emax (maximum percent reduction in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate from baseline) and <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> (plasma <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> concentration that achieves half Emax) were 52 +/- 17% and 110 +/- 84 ng/ml, respectively. The model predicts that mean plasma <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> concentration of 79, 172, and 294 ng/ml are required to produce a 20%, 30%, and 40% reduction in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate, respectively. A relation between plasma <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> concentration and percent change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline was not observed (mean +/- SD r2, SBP/DBP: 0.35 +/- 0.24/0.36 +/- 0.2). There were no untoward side effects observed. CONCLUSIONS: First, the pharmacokinetics of <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> in patients with <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> fibrillation or <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> flutter is nonlinear with an apparent dose-dependent decrease in systemic clearance with increasing infusion rate. Second, using a sigmoidal Emax model, there is a strong relation between plasma <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> concentration and percent <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> rate reduction. Third, the plasma concentrations of the principal metabolites desacetyldiltiazem and N-desmethyldiltiazem are low and are not expected to contribute significantly to the pharmacodynamics of intravenous <span class=\"chemicals\">diltiazem</span> in these patients.</td>\n",

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of mutations in KCNJ8 with Brugada syndrome (BrS) and early repolarization syndrome (ERS) and to elucidate the mechanism underlying the gain of function of ATP-sensitive potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> current. METHODS: Direct sequencing of KCNJ8 and other candidate genes was performed on 204 BrS and ERS probands and family members. Whole-cell and inside-out <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> methods were used to study mutated <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> expressed in TSA201 cells. RESULTS: The same missense mutation, p.Ser422Leu (c.1265C>T) in KCNJ8, was identified in 3 BrS and 1 ERS probands but was absent in 430 alleles from ethnically matched healthy controls. Additional genetic variants included CACNB2b-D601E. Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> studies showed a 2-fold gain of function of glibenclamide-sensitive ATP-sensitive potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> current when KCNJ8-S422L was coexpressed with SUR2A-wild type. Inside-out <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> evaluation yielded a significantly greater half maximal <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> concentration for ATP in the mutant <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> (785.5 ± 2 vs 38.4 ± 3 μM; n = 5; P <.01), pointing to incomplete closing of the ATP-sensitive potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> under normoxic conditions. Patients with a CACNB2b-D601E polymorphism displayed longer <span class=\"effect\">QT</span>/corrected <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> intervals, likely owing to their effect to induce an increase in <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium channel</span> current (I(Ca-L)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that KCNJ8 is a susceptibility gene for BrS and ERS and point to S422L as a possible hotspot mutation. Our findings suggest that the S422L-induced gain of function in ATP-sensitive potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> current is due to reduced sensitivity to intracellular ATP.</td>\n",

The intoxication syndrome consists of hiccups, mental confusion, dizziness, and vomiting. On the other hand, folk medicine uses teas and infusions of carambola leaves to treat headache, vomiting, cough, insomnia, and diabetes. This motivated us to determine if Averrhoa carambola can act on the contractility and automaticity of the <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. We measured the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> isometric force in stimulated left atria and determined the chronotropic changes in spontaneously beating right atria. The carambola leaf extracts (1.5 mg/ml) abolished the contractile force in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the crude, methanolic, ethanolic, aqueous, and acetic extracts, the aqueous one was the most potent (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 520 +/- 94 microg/ml; flavonoids and tannins are the main constituents; <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ and K+ contents in 1.0 mg/ml of aqueous extract were 0.12 +/- 0.016 and 1.19 +/- 0.15 mM, respectively). The aqueous extract abolished the positive Bowditch staircase phenomenon and reduced the <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> response to CaCl2 (0.17-8.22 mM), events that are dependent on the cellular Ca2+ inward current. The adrenergic, muscarinic or opioid membrane receptors do not seem to participate in the mechanism of action of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioactive</span> substance(s). In spontaneously beating atria, the aqueous extract promoted a negative chronotropic effect that was antagonized by 0.1 microM isoproterenol bitartrate. With this agonist, the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of the aqueous extract increased from 133 +/- 58 to 650 +/- 100 microg/ml.

METHODS: The single electrode <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> technique was used to study the effects of H 345/52 on the rapid component of the delayed rectifying potassium current, I(Kr), and the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (I(Ca)). Differential effects of H 345/52 and almokalant on APD prolongation were studied in a <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> Purkinje fibre/<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> muscle preparation. The temporal variability of the action potential duration (APD) and its relation to proarrhythmias was examined in Langendorff-perfused <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> hearts administered H 345/52 or almokalant. Anaesthetised, methoxamine-sensitised rabbits were used to assess the propensity of intravenous H 345/52 and ibutilide to induce torsades de pointes (<span class=\"effect\">TdP</span>). RESULTS: H 345/52 potently <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(Kr) (IC(50)=40 nM) without consequential use-dependency. The I(Ca) was also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span>, but at higher concentrations (IC(50)=1.3 microM). <span class=\"other_terms\">Block</span> of I(Ca) was markedly frequency-dependent (positive) and influenced by membrane potential, such that H 345/52 was more effective following clamp steps from plateau potentials than from -80 mV. In the Purkinje fibre-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> muscle preparation, almokalant prolonged the Purkinje fibre APD preferentially, whereas H 345/52 homogeneously prolonged APD in both tissue types. In the perfused <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>, H 345/52 (1 microM) and almokalant (0.3 microM) prolonged APD to a similar degree but increased the temporal variability of APD differently, from 3+/-0.4 ms in control hearts to 8+/-1.2 ms and to 38+/-7.5 ms (P<0.001 vs. H 345/52), respectively. Unequivocal early after-depolarisations were seen in 5/6 almokalant-perfused hearts but in no <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> administered H 345/52 (P<0.05). In anaesthetised rabbits, H 345/52 (17.4 micromol/kg) or ibutilide (2.6 micromol/kg maximum), maximally lengthened the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval from 133+/-4.5 to 177+/-8.0 ms and from 125+/-5.1 to 166+/-9.3 ms (P<0.001, n=8). However, whereas ibutilide induced <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> in all animals at 0.06+/-0.009 micromol/kg, H 345/52 did not induce <span class=\"effect\">TdP</span> (P=0.0002) at up to 17.4 micromol/kg.

Effects of specific <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonism</span> were explored in a gain-of-function murine LQT3 model produced by a DeltaKPQ 1505-1507 deletion in the SCN5A gene. Monophasic action potentials (MAPs) were recorded from epicardial and endocardial surfaces of intact, Langendorff-perfused Scn5a+/Delta hearts. In untreated Scn5a+/Delta hearts, epicardial action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) was 60.0 +/- 0.9 ms compared with 46.9 +/- 1.6 ms in untreated wild-type (WT) hearts (P < 0.05; n = 5). The corresponding endocardial APD(90) values were 52.0 +/- 0.7 ms and 53.7 +/- 1.6 ms in Scn5a+/Delta and WT hearts, respectively (P > 0.05; n = 5). Epicardial early afterdepolarizations (EADs), often accompanied by spontaneous <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"effect\">tachycardia</span> (VT), occurred in 100% of MAPs from Scn5a+/Delta but not in any WT hearts (n = 10). However, EAD occurrence was reduced to 62 +/- 7.1%, 44 +/- 9.7%, 10 +/- 10% and 0% of MAPs following perfusion with 10 nm, 100 nm, 300 nm and 1 mum <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>, respectively (P < 0.05; n = 5), giving an effective <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> concentration of 79.3 nm. Programmed electrical stimulation (PES) induced VT in all five Scn5a+/Delta hearts (n = 5) but not in any WT hearts (n = 5). However, repeat PES induced VT in 3, 2, 2 and 0 out of 5 Scn5a+/Delta hearts following perfusion with 10 nm, 100 nm, 300 nm and 1 mum <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>, respectively. <span class=\"assays\">Patch clamp</span> studies in isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes from Scn5a+/Delta and WT hearts confirmed that <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> (300 nm) completely suppressed the inward Ca2+ current but had no effect on inward <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ currents. No significant effects were seen on epicardial APD90, endocardial APD90 or <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> effective refractory period in Scn5a+/Delta and WT hearts following perfusion with <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> at 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, 300 nm and 1 microm <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> concentrations. We conclude that <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonism</span> thus exerts specific <span class=\"effect\">anti-arrhythmic</span> effects in Scn5a+/Delta hearts through suppression of EADs.</td>\n",

This study measured the actions of diverse agents on action potentials (AP) and ion currents recorded from hiPSC-CM. METHODS: During AP experiments, the hiPSC-CM were paced at 1Hz during a baseline period, and when increasing concentrations of test <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> were administered at 4-minute intervals. AP parameters, including duration (APD60 and APD90), resting membrane potential, rate of rise, and amplitude, were measured throughout the entire experiment. <span class=\"assays\">Voltage clamp</span> experiments with <span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span> and <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> were similarly conducted. RESULTS: <span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span> produced a dose-dependent prolongation of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> action potential and <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the hERG/IKr current with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 17nM. At 3nM, <span class=\"chemicals\">dofetilide</span> significantly increased APD90. Astemizole significantly increased APD60 and APD90 at 30nM. <span class=\"chemicals\">Terfenadine</span> significantly increased APD90 at concentrations greater than 10nM. Fexofenadine, a metabolite of <span class=\"chemicals\">terfenadine</span>, did not produce any <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiologic</span> changes in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> action potentials. Flecainide produced a dose-dependent prolongation of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> action potential at 1 and 3μM. Acute exposure to <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> significantly decreased APD60 and APD90 and produced a dose-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 0.039μM. <span class=\"chemicals\">Verapamil</span> first shortened APD60 and APD90 in a dose-dependent manner, until a compensating increase in APD90, presumably via hERG <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span>, was observed at 1 and 3μM. Following a chronic exposure (20-24h) to clinically relevant levels of pentamidine, a significant increase in action potential duration was accompanied by early afterdepolarizations (EADs). DISCUSSION: These experiments show the ability of AP measured from hiPSC-CM to record the interactions of various ion <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> via AP recording and avoid the limitations of using several single ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> assays in a noncardiac tissue.</td>\n",

In the acute phase of the OH-mediated diastolic dysfunction, increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels and alterations of myofilaments may play a role, but the relative contribution of these systems to <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> dysfunction is unknown. Intact contracting <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> trabeculae from rabbits were exposed to OH, resulting in an increase in diastolic force (F(dia)) by 540%. Skinned fiber experiments revealed that OH-exposed preparations were sensitized for Ca(2+) (EC(50): 3.27+/-0.24 x 10(-6) versus 2.69+/-0.15 x 10(-6) mol/L; P<0.05), whereas maximal force development was unaltered. Western blots showed a proteolytic degradation of troponin T (TnT) with intact troponin I (TnI). <span class=\"other_terms\">Blocking</span> of calpain I by MDL-28.170 inhibited both TnT-proteolysis and Ca(2+) sensitization, but failed to prevent the acute diastolic dysfunction in the intact preparation. The OH-induced diastolic dysfunction was similar in preparations with intact (540+/-93%) and pharmacologically <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> sarcoplasmic reticulum (539+/-77%), and was also similar in presence of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca(2+)-channel </span><span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>. In sharp contrast, inhibition of the reverse-mode <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span>-<span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> exchange by KB-R7943 preserved diastolic function completely. Additional experiments were performed in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span>; the rise in diastolic force was comparable to <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span>, but Ca(2+) sensitivity was unchanged and maximal force development was reduced. This was associated with a degradation of TnI, but not TnT. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that OH did not cause irreversible membrane damage. We conclude that OH-induced acute diastolic dysfunction is caused by Ca(2+) influx via reverse mode of the <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span>-<span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> exchanger.

In the present study, therefore, the concentration-dependent effects of ropinirole on action potential morphology and the underlying ion currents were studied in enzymatically dispersed canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> using standard microelectrode, conventional whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span>, and action potential <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> techniques. At concentrations > or = 1 microM, ropinirole increased action potential duration (APD(90)) and suppressed the rapid delayed rectifier K(+) current (I (Kr)) with an IC(50) value of 2.7 +/- 0.25 microM and Hill coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.09. The <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> increased with increasing depolarizations to more positive voltages, but paradoxically, the activation of I (Kr) was accelerated by 3 muM ropinirole (time constant decreased from 34 +/- 4 to 14 +/- 1 ms). No significant changes in the fast and slow deactivation time constants were observed with ropinirole. At higher concentrations, ropinirole decreased the amplitude of early repolarization (at concentrations > or = 10 microM), reduced the maximum rate of depolarization and caused depression of the plateau (at concentrations > or = 30 microM), and shortened APD measured at 50% repolarization (at 300 microM) indicating a concentration-dependent inhibition of I (to), I (<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>), and I (Ca). Suppression of I (Kr), I (to), and I (Ca) has been confirmed under conventional <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> and action potential <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> conditions. I (Ks) and I (K1) were not influenced significantly by ropinirole at concentrations less than 300 microM. All these effects of ropinirole were fully reversible upon washout. The results indicate that ropinirole treatment may carry proarrhythmic risk for patients with inherited or acquired long <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> syndrome due to inhibition of I (Kr)-especially in cases of accidental overdose or intoxication.</td>\n",

In the perfused whole <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> model, HA-7 caused a prolongation in the basic cycle length, <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> repolarization time, and the atrioventricular (AV) nodal Wenckebach cycle length and prolonged the refractory period of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>, AV node, and His-Purkinje system. The atrioventricular conduction interval was also prolonged in a frequency-dependent manner. In isolated hearts, HA-7 significantly raised the threshold for experimental <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> fibrillation and reduced the occurrence of reperfusion-induced <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> fibrillation. Conventional microelectrode-recording study shows that HA-7, but not d-<span class=\"chemicals\">sotalol</span>, prolonged the action potential duration (APD) and decreased the maximum rate of depolarization in isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> strips. In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles, higher concentrations of HA-7 caused a prolongation of APD(90) in a frequency-independent manner, whereas d-<span class=\"chemicals\">sotalol</span> exerted a reverse frequency-dependent action on this parameter. Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> results on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes indicate that HA-7 decreased both the slow (I(Ks)) (IC(50) = 4.8 muM) and fast component (I(Kr)) (IC(50) = 1.1 muM) of the delayed rectifier K(+) currents. Similar results could also be observed in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes. The inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) was also reduced somewhat by HA-7. HA-7 also suppressed the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) inward current (I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>)) (IC(50) = 2.9 muM) and inhibited the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) (IC(50) = 4.0 muM, maximal inhibition = 69%) to a lesser extent. We conclude that HA-7 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> multiple ionic currents and that these changes affect the <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> properties of the conduction system as well as the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> tissues and may contribute to its <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> efficacy.</td>\n",

O-methyl-neocaryachine (OMNC) suppressed the ischaemia/reperfusion-induced <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> in Langendorff-perfused <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hearts (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>=4.3 microM). Its <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> effects on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes and the conduction system in isolated hearts as well as the electromechanical effects on the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles were examined. 2. In <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles, OMNC prolonged the action potential duration (APD) and decreased the maximal rate of depolarization (V(max)). As compared to <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span>, OMNC exerted less effects on both the V(max) and APD but a positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect. 3. In the <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> study, OMNC decreased <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ current (I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>)) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>=0.9 microM) with a negative-shift of the <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> inactivation and a slowed rate of recovery from inactivation. The voltage dependence of I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) activation was, however, unaffected. With repetitive depolarizations, OMNC <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>) frequency-dependently. OMNC <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> I(Ca) with an IC(50) of 6.6 microM and a maximum inhibition of 40.7%. 4. OMNC inhibited the transient outward K+ current (I(to)) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>=9.5 microM) with an acceleration of its rate of inactivation and a slowed rate of recovery from inactivation. However, it produced little change in the steady-state inactivation curve. The steady-state outward K+ current (I(SS)) was inhibited with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 8.7 microM. The inward rectifier K+ current (I(K1)) was also reduced by OMNC. 5. In the perfused <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> model, OMNC (3 to 30 microM) prolonged the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> repolarization time, the spontaneous cycle length and the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> refractory period. The conduction through the AV node and His-Purkinje system, as well as the AV nodal refractory period and Wenckebach cycle length were also prolonged (30 microM). 6. In conclusion, OMNC <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+, I(to) and I(SS) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> and in similar concentrations partly <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span>. These effects lead to a modification of the electromechanical function and may likely contribute to the termination of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>. These results provide an opportunity to develop an effective <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> agent with modest positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span> as well as low proarrhythmic potential.</td>\n",

The <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> potential and electromechanical effects of liriodenine, an aporphine alkaloid isolated from the plant, Fissistigma glaucescens, were examined. 2. In the Langendorff perfused (with constant pressure) <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>, at a concentration of 0.3 to 3 microM, liriodenine was able to convert a polymorphic <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> tachyrhythmia induced by the ischaemia-reperfusion (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 0.3 microM). 3. In isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> muscle, liriodenine increased the contractile force and slowed the spontaneous beating of the right <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>. 4. The liriodenine-induced positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span> was markedly attenuated by a transient outward K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span>, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) but was not significantly affected by prazosin, <span class=\"chemicals\">propranolol</span>, <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span> or carbachol. 5. In <span class=\"species\">rat</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, liriodenine prolonged action potential duration and decreased the maximal upstroke velocity of phase 0 depolarization (Vmax) and resting membrane potential in a concentration-dependent manner. The action potential amplitude was not significantly changed. 6. Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> study revealed that liriodenine <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> (INa) concentration-dependently (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 0.7 microM) and caused a leftward shift of its steady-state inactivation curve. However, its recovery rate from the inactivated state was not affected. The <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ currents (Ica) were also decreased, but to a lesser degree (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 2.5 microM, maximal inhibition = 35%). 7. Liriodenine inhibited the 4-AP-sensitive transient outward current (Ito) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 2.8 microM) and moderately accelerated its rate of decay. The <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of Ito was not associated with changes in the voltage-dependence of the steady-state inactivation curve or in the process of recovery from inactivation of the current. Liriodenine also reduced the amplitude of a slowly inactivating, steady-state outward current (Iss) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 1.9 microM). These effects were consistent with its prolonging effect on action potential duration. The inwardly rectifying background K+ current (IK1), was also decreased but to a less degree. 8. Compared to <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span>, liriodenine exerted a stronger degree of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> on INa, comparable degree of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> on IK1, and lesser extent of <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> on ICa and Ito. 9. It is concluded that, through inhibition of <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ and the Ito <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>, liriodenine can suppress <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> induced by <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> ischaemia reperfusion.

In the present study, the concentration-dependent effects of articaine on action potential morphology and the underlying ion currents were studied in isolated canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. METHODS: Action potentials were recorded from the enzymatically dispersed myocytes using sharp microelectrodes (16 cells from 3 dogs). Conventional <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> and action potential <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> arrangements were used to study the effects of articaine on transmembrane ion currents (37 cells from 14 dogs). RESULTS: Articaine-induced concentration-dependent changes in action potential configuration including shortening of the action potentials, reduction of their amplitude and maximum velocity of depolarization (V(max)), suppression of early repolarization and depression of plateau. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value obtained for the V(max) <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was 162 (sd 30) microM. Both the reduction of V(max) and action potential shortening were frequency dependent: the former was more prominent at shorter, while the latter at longer pacing cycle lengths. A rate dependent V(max) <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>, having rapid offset kinetics [tau = 91 (20) ms], was observed in addition to <span class=\"effect\">tonic</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>. Under <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> conditions, a variety of ion currents were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by articaine: I(Ca) [<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 471 (75) microM], I(to) [<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 365 (62) microM], I(K1) [<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 372 (46) microM], I(Kr) [<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 278 (79) microM], and I(Ks) [<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 326 (65) microM]. Hill coefficients were close to unity indicating a single <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site for articaine, except for I(K1). CONCLUSIONS: Articaine can modify <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> action potentials and ion currents at concentrations higher than the therapeutic range which can be achieved only by accidental venous injection. Since its suppressive effects on the inward and outward currents are relatively well balanced, the articaine-induced changes in action potential morphology may be moderate even in the case of overdose.</td>\n",

This suggests that specific alterations in the beta-adrenergic receptor complex develop in this setting. The present study is an examination of individual components of the beta-adrenergic receptor complex with the aim of elucidating the biochemical defect(s) that might be responsible for the diminished beta-adrenergic receptor responsiveness in the myocytes that survive in the infarcted <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared components of the beta-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway in membranes prepared from the EBZ of the 5-day infarcted <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> and a remote, noninfarcted region (RZ) of the same <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricle</span> as well as the corresponding regions of noninfarcted <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricles</span>. Defects in multiple components of the beta-adrenergic receptor complex were confined to the EBZ of the 5-day infarcted <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. These include a decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor density; diminished basal, guanine nucleotide-, isoproterenol-, forskolin-, and manganese-dependent adenylyl cyclase activities; an increase in the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for isoproterenol-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase; a diminished level of the alpha-subunit of the Gs protein. and an elevated level of the alpha-subunit of the Gi protein. CONCLUSIONS: Defects in multiple components of the membrane beta-adrenergic receptor complex were identified in the EBZ of the 5-day infarcted canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>. This constellation of abnormalities would be predicted to impair functional beta-adrenergic responsiveness and contribute to the defect in isoproterenol-dependent stimulation of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current in myocytes isolated from this tissue.</td>\n",

However, conflicting results have been reported concerning the density of <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (I Ca(L)), and the mechanisms underlying the decreased  -adrenergic <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> response. We determined I Ca(L) density, cytoplasmic <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> ([Ca2+]i) transients, and the effects of  -adrenergic stimulation (isoproterenol) in a model of postinfarction <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> failure in rats. Left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes were obtained by enzymatic digestion 8-10 weeks after infarction. <span class=\"assays\">Electrophysiological</span> recordings were obtained using the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. [Ca2+]i transients were investigated via fura-2 fluorescence.  -Adrenergic receptor density was determined by [ H]-dihydroalprenolol <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricle</span> homogenates. Postinfarction myocytes showed a significant 25% reduction in mean I Ca(L) density (5.7   0.28 vs 7.6   0.32 pA/pF) and a 19% reduction in mean peak [Ca2+]i transients (0.13   0.007 vs 0.16   0.009) compared to sham myocytes. The isoproterenol-stimulated increase in I Ca(L) was significantly smaller in postinfarction myocytes (Emax: 63.6   4.3 vs 123.3   0.9% in sham myocytes), but <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> was not altered. The isoproterenol-stimulated peak amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients was also blunted in postinfarction myocytes. Adenylate cyclase activation through forskolin produced similar I Ca(L) increases in both groups.  -Adrenergic receptor density was significantly reduced in homogenates from infarcted hearts (Bmax: 93.89   20.22 vs 271.5   31.43 fmol/mg protein in sham myocytes), while Kd values were similar. We conclude that postinfarction myocytes from large infarcts display reduced I Ca(L) density and peak [Ca2+]i transients. The response to  -adrenergic stimulation was also reduced and was probably related to  -adrenergic receptor down-regulation and not to changes in adenylate cyclase activity.</td>\n",

In the present study therefore concentration-dependent effects of rosiglitazone on action potential morphology and the underlying ion currents were studied in <span class=\"species\">dog</span> hearts. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Standard microelectrode techniques, conventional whole cell <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> and action potential <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> techniques were applied in enzymatically dispersed <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells from <span class=\"species\">dog</span> hearts. KEY RESULTS: At concentrations ≥10 µM rosiglitazone decreased the amplitude of phase-1 repolarization, reduced the maximum velocity of depolarization and caused depression of the plateau potential. These effects developed rapidly and were readily reversible upon washout. Rosiglitazone suppressed several transmembrane ion currents, concentration-dependently, under conventional <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> conditions and altered their kinetic properties. The EC(50) value for this inhibition was 25.2 ± 2.7 µM for the transient outward K(+) current (I(to)), 72.3 ± 9.3 µM for the rapid delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr)) and 82.5 ± 9.4 µM for the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca) ) with Hill coefficients close to unity. The inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) was not affected by rosiglitazone up to concentrations of 100 µM. Suppression of I(to), I(Kr), and I(Ca) was confirmed also under action potential <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> conditions. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Alterations in the densities and kinetic properties of ion currents may carry serious pro-<span class=\"effect\">arrhythmic</span> risk in case of overdose with rosiglitazone, especially in patients having multiple <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> risk factors, like elderly diabetic patients.</td>\n",

The aim of this report is to elucidate the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> properties of rosiglitazone (R) on isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> and murine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle cells and canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes using conventional microelectrode, whole cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span>, and action potential (AP) <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> techniques. In histidine-decarboxylase knockout mice as well as in their wild types R (1-30 µM) shortened AP duration at 90% level of repolarization (APD(90)) and increased the AP amplitude (APA) in a concentration-dependent manner. In <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscle cells R (1-30 µM) caused a significant reduction of APA and maximum velocity of depolarization (V(max)) which was accompanied by lengthening of APD(90). In single canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes at concentrations ≥10 µM R decreased the amplitude of phase-1 repolarization, the plateau potential and reduced V(max). R suppressed several ion currents in a concentration-dependent manner under <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> conditions. The EC(50) value for this inhibition was 25.2±2.7 µM for the transient outward K(+ ) current (I(to)), 72.3±9.3 µM for the rapid delayed rectifier K(+ ) current (I(Kr)), and 82.5±9.4 µM for the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+ ) current (I(Ca)) with Hill coefficients close to unity. The inward rectifier K(+ ) current (I(K1)) was not affected by R up to concentrations of 100 µM. Suppression of I(to), I(Kr), and I(Ca) has been confirmed under action potential <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> conditions as well. The observed alterations in the AP morphology and densities of ion currents may predict serious proarrhythmic risk in case of intoxication with R as a consequence of overdose or decreased elimination of the drug, particularly in patients having multiple <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> risk factors, such as elderly diabetic patients.</td>\n",

In the current study, therefore, the concentration-dependent effects of ropivacaine on action potential morphology and the underlying ion currents were studied and compared with those of bupivacaine in isolated canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. METHODS: Action potentials were recorded from the enzymatically dispersed cells using sharp microelectrodes. Conventional <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> and action potential <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> arrangements were used to study the effects of ropivacaine on transmembrane ion currents. RESULTS: Ropivacaine induced concentration- and frequency-dependent changes in action potential configuration, including shortening of the action potentials, reduction of their amplitude and maximum velocity of depolarization, suppression of early repolarization, and depression of plateau. Reduction in maximum velocity of depolarization was characterized with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> value of 81 +/- 7 microm at 1 Hz. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with bupivacaine (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 47 +/- 3 microm). Under <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> conditions, a variety of ion currents were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by ropivacaine: <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 263 +/- 67 microm), transient outward current (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 384 +/- 75 microm), inward rectifier potassium current (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 372 +/- 35 microm), rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 303 +/- 47 microm), and slow delayed rectifier potassium current (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 106 +/- 18 microm). CONCLUSIONS: Ropivacaine, similarly to bupivacaine, can modify <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> action potentials and the underlying ion currents at concentrations higher than the usual therapeutic range. However, in cases of overdose, <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> complications may be anticipated both during and after anesthesia due to the <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> of various ion currents.</td>\n",

To assess the impact of nonphosphorylatable phospholamban, a S16A, T17A double-mutant (DM) was introduced into phospholamban knockout <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> hearts. Transgenic lines expressing DM phospholamban at levels similar to wild types (WT) were identified. In vitro phosphorylation confirmed that DM phospholamban could not be phosphorylated, but produced the same shift in <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of SERCA2a for Ca2+ as unphosphorylated WT phospholamban. Rates of basal twitch [Ca2+]i decline were not different in DM versus WT <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. Isoproterenol increased the rates of twitch [Ca2+]i decline in WT, but not DM myocytes, confirming the prominent role of phospholamban phosphorylation in this response. Increased <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (ICa) density, with unaltered characteristics, was the major compensation in DM myocytes. Consequently, the normal beta-adrenergic-induced increase in ICa caused larger dynamic changes in absolute ICa density. Isoproterenol increased Ca2+ transients to a comparable amplitude in DM and WT. There were no changes in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, or the expression levels and Ca2+ removal activities of other Ca2+-handling proteins. Nor was there evidence of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> remodeling up to 10 months of age. Thus, chronic inhibition of SERCA2a by ablation of phospholamban phosphorylation (abolishing its adrenergic regulation) results in a unique cellular adaptation involving greater dynamic ICa modulation. This ICa modulation may partly compensate for the loss in SERCA2a responsiveness and thereby partially normalize beta-adrenergic <span class=\"effect\">inotropy</span> in DM phospholamban mice.</td>\n",

Volatile anesthetics protect the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> against reperfusion injury primarily by attenuating Ca overload. This study investigated <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> mechanisms underlying <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> effects of sevoflurane against oxidative stress-induced cellular injury. METHODS: The cytosolic Ca levels and cell morphology were assessed in <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, using confocal fluo-3 fluorescence imaging, whereas membrane potentials and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca current</span> (<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>) were recorded using whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques. Phosphorylation of Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II was examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: Exposure to H2O2 (100 μM) for 15 min evoked cytosolic Ca elevation and hypercontracture in 56.8% of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes in 11 experiments, which was partly but significantly reduced by <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>, tetracaine, or SEA0400. Sevoflurane prevented H2O2-induced cellular Ca overload in a concentration-dependent way (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 1.35%). Isoflurane (2%) and desflurane (10%) also protected <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes by a degree similar to sevoflurane (3%). Sevoflurane suppressed H2O2-induced <span class=\"assays\">electrophysiological</span> disturbances, including early afterdepolarizations, voltage fluctuations in resting potential, and abnormal automaticities. H2O2 significantly enhanced <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> by activating Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and subsequent addition of sevoflurane, isoflurane, or desflurane similarly reduced <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span> to below baseline levels. Phosphorylated Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II increased after 10-min incubation with H2O2, which was significantly prevented by concomitant administration of sevoflurane. CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane protected <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes against H2O2-induced Ca overload and hypercontracture, presumably by affecting multiple Ca transport pathways, including <span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>, <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca exchanger and ryanodine receptor. These actions appear to mediate <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotection</span> against reperfusion injury associated with oxidative stress.</td>\n",

The detailed mechanisms underlying these effects, however, are not entirely understood. The aim of this study was to elucidate the electromechanical effects of CAPE in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> preparations. Intracardiac electrograms, left <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> (LV) pressure, and the <span class=\"effect\">anti-arrhythmic</span> efficacy were determined using isolated hearts. Action potentials of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles were assessed with microelectrodes, Ca(2+) transients were measured by fluorescence, and ion fluxes were measured by <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques. In a perfused <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> model, CAPE prolonged the atrio-<span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> conduction interval, the Wenckebach cycle length, and the refractory periods of the AV node and His-Purkinje system, while shortening the <span class=\"effect\">QT</span> interval. CAPE reduced the occurrence of reperfusion-induced <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> fibrillation and decreased LV pressure in isolated hearts. In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles, CAPE shortened the action potential duration and reduced both the maximum upstroke velocity and contractile force. In fura-2-loaded single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, CAPE decreased cell shortening and the Ca(2+) transient amplitude. <span class=\"assays\">Patch-clamp</span> experiments revealed that CAPE produced a <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> decrease in <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (<span class=\"calcium\">ICa,L</span>) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>=1.1 μM) and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) current (INa) (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span>=0.43 μM), caused a negative-shift of the <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> inactivation and a delay of recovery from inactivation. CAPE decreased the delayed outward K(+) current (IK) slightly, without affecting the inward rectifier K(+) current (IK1). These results suggest that the preferential inhibition of Ca(2+) inward and <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) inward currents by CAPE may induce major electromechanical alterations in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> preparations, which may underlie its <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> action.</td>\n",

We therefore investigated the effects of the main female sex hormone, 17beta-<span class=\"chemicals\">estradiol</span>, on ischaemia-induced <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span> and on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current (ICaL). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vivo experiments were performed in pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats subjected to acute coronary artery occlusion. ICaL was measured by the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique, in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. KEY RESULTS: Acute intravenous administration of 17beta-<span class=\"chemicals\">estradiol</span> as a bolus dose followed by a continuous infusion, commencing 10 min before coronary artery occlusion, had dose-dependent <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> activity. In female rats 300 ng kg(-1) + 30 ng kg(-1) min(-1) 17beta-<span class=\"chemicals\">estradiol</span> significantly reduced the number of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> premature beats (VPBs) and the incidence of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> fibrillation (VF). A ten fold higher dose of 17beta-<span class=\"chemicals\">estradiol</span> was required to cause similar effects in male rats. In vitro 17beta-<span class=\"chemicals\">estradiol</span> reduced peak ICaL in a concentration-dependent manner. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> was ten-fold higher in male myocytes (0.66 microM) than in females (0.06 microM). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results indicate that 17beta-<span class=\"chemicals\">estradiol</span> has marked dose-dependent <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> activity that is greater in female rats than in males. A similar differential <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> in <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> ICaL in myocytes from female and male rats can account for this effect. This provides an explanation for the <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> activity of 17beta-<span class=\"chemicals\">estradiol</span> and gender-selective protection against sudden <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> death.</td>\n",

The peptide is a potent positive <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> agent, the effects of which are mediated by increases in cytosolic Ca2+ in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>. The object of this study was to investigate at the cellular level, the actions of ET-1 on contractile function and on Ca2+ currents in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>-failed <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span>. Male New Zealand White rabbits (8 wks) were treated with twice weekly injections of epirubicin (4 mg/kg/wk, n = 7) or with saline (n = 7) for 6 wks, followed by a washout period of 2 wks. <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">Ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> were isolated from <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> hearts using Langendorff perfusion with collagenase; contractile function was examined using a video microscopy method, and <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ currents were recorded using a whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique. ET-1 produced a concentration-dependent increase in contractile response (% increase from basal value) to a maximum at 1 nM ET-1 of 69 +/- 11% (mean +/- S.D.) in control <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> and 33 +/- 6% in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>-failed cells. However, there was no significant change in the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> obtained with ET-1 for healthy (0.31 +/- 0.1 nM) and for failed <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> (0.24 +/- 0.1 nM). The effects of ET-1 on <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca2+ channels</span> were similar with a peak amplitude at 1 nM ET-1 of -3.26 +/- 0.8 <span class=\"sodium\">nA</span> in control <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> and -3.32 +/- 0.9 <span class=\"sodium\">nA</span> in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>-failed cells. The attenuation of the contractile response to ET-1 in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>-failed cells may reflect a desensitization of ET receptors as a consequence of elevated circulating levels of ET and was not reflected by alteration of transmembrane Ca2+ conductance. It is probable, therefore, that multiple signalling pathways are involved in the actions of ET on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span>.</td>\n",

This study aimed to determine its electromechanical and <span class=\"effect\">anti-arrhythmic</span> effects in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> hearts. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Microelectrodes were used to study action potentials in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles. Fluo-3 fluorimetric ratio and whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> techniques were used to record <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> transients and membrane currents in single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, respectively. Intracardiac electrocardiograms were obtained and the <span class=\"effect\">anti-arrhythmic</span> efficacy was determined from isolated perfused hearts. KEY RESULTS: In <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">papillary</span> muscles, cinnamophilin decreased the maximal rate of upstroke (V(max)) and duration of action potential, and reduced the contractile force. In single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, cinnamophilin reduced Ca(2+) transient amplitude. Cinnamophilin decreased the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L))(IC(50)=7.5 microM) with use-dependency, induced a negative shift of the <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> inactivation and retarded recovery from inactivation. Cinnamophilin also decreased the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) current (I(<span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>)) (IC(50)=2.7 microM) and to a lesser extent, the delayed outward (I(K)), inward rectifier (I(K1)), and ATP-sensitive (I(K,ATP)) K(+) currents. In isolated perfused hearts, cinnamophilin prolonged the AV nodal conduction interval and Wenckebach cycle length and the refractory periods of the AV node, His-Purkinje system and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricle</span>, while shortening the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> repolarization time. Additionally, cinnamophilin reduced the occurrence of reperfusion-induced <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> fibrillation.

The increasing utility of transgenic mice in molecular studies of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> system has motivated us to characterize the ionic currents in neonatal <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. 2. Cell capacitance measurements (30 +/- 1 pF, n = 73) confirmed visual impressions that neonatal <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes in primary culture are considerably smaller than freshly isolated adult <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. With the use of electron microscopy, mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum were found in close association with myofibrils, but transverse tubules were not observed. 3. Action potential durations, measured at 50 and 90% repolarization, were 23 +/- 1 and 42 +/- 2 ms respectively (n = 46). Application of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 5 mM) prolonged action potential duration at 50% repolarization by 26 +/- 5% (n = 3). The brevity of the action potential is explained by the rapid activation of a transient outward K+ current upon <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> depolarization to plateau potentials. 4. Potassium currents identified include an inward rectifier, a large 4-AP-sensitive transient outward, a slowly inactivating 4-AP-insensitive outward, a slowly activating delayed rectifier and a small rapidly activating <span class=\"chemicals\">E-4031</span> (10 microM)-sensitive delayed rectifier K+ current. 5. <span class=\"sodium\">Sodium</span> currents (-305 +/- 50 pA pF-1, n = 21) were recorded in 40 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ with Ni2+ (1 mM) to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> Ca2+ currents and with K+ replaced by Cs+. The relative insensitivity of the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ current to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> by tetrodotoxin (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 2.2 +/- 0.3 microM, n = 4) is distinctive of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> isoform. 6. <span class=\"chemicals\">Nitrendipine</span>-insensitive (10 microM) Ba2+ currents elicited during steps from -90 to -30 mV measured -25 +/- 5 pA pF-1 (n = 7, 30 mM Ba2+). Decay of these currents was complete during 180 ms depolarizations, even with Ba2+ as the charge carrier. These currents were not present when the holding potential was set at -50 mV. These data support the presence of a low threshold, T-type Ca2+ current. 7. The maximal <span class=\"chemicals\">nitrendipine</span>-sensitive <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca2+ current density was -10 +/- 2 pA pF-1 (n = 8) in 2 mM Ca2+ and -38 +/- 5 pA pF-1 (n = 9) in 30 mM Ba2+. Exposure to isoprenaline (1 microM) resulted in an 82% increase (n = 3) in the amplitude of the Ba2+ currents elicited at 0 mV. 8. Neonatal <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes in primary culture possess surprisingly large inward currents given the brevity of their action potentials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>\n",

       "      <td> 1. The effect of sulmazole and several structurally related <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> gating and on [3H]-ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to isolated SR membrane vesicles has been investigated. 2. The optical isomers, (+)- and (-)-sulmazole, increased the open probability (Po) of single Ca(2+)-release <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> incorporated into phospholipid bilayers held under <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> by increasing the frequency and duration of open events. The respective <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50s</span> were 423 microM and 465 microM at 10 microM activating cytosolic Ca2+ and the Hill coefficients for activation were approximately two, suggesting that at least two <span class=\"chem\">molecules</span> of either enantiomer are required to bind for <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activation. 3. Similarly the related enantiomers, (+)- and (-)-isomazole, which differ from sulmazole in the position of the pyridine nitrogen (4.5b for sulmazole; 4.5c for isomazole), were approximately as potent as each other and as potent as the isomers of sulmazole with <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50s</span> of approximately 445 microM. 4. In contrast, EMD 46512 and EMD 41000, which are sulmazole and isomazole <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> respectively, each with the methylsulphinyl oxygen removed, increased single-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> Po with <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50s</span> of 42 microM and 40 microM. The open and closed lifetime distributions were similar to those of the less potent <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> and the Hill coefficients were the same, suggesting that these <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> act at the sulmazole site on the Ca(2+)-release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. 5. All of the <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> tested were able to increase the Po of <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in the absence of activating Ca2+ but were less potent than in the presence of Ca2+. The drugs were effective only when added to the cytosolic face of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. None of the drugs could fully activate the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> in the absence of Ca2+,partly due to only one drug <span class=\"chem\">molecule</span> <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> in the absence of Ca2+, which is in contrast to the situation when activating Ca2+ is present. This suggests a synergistic action of these drugs and Ca2+ in Ca2+-release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activation.6. EMD 46512 and EMD 41000 increased [3H]-ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to HSR vesicles with Hill coefficients of approximately two and <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50s</span> of 25 MicroM and 28 MicroM, respectively, at 10 MicroM Ca2+. These drugs also increased [3H]-ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to HSR vesicles at PM Ca2+ but with Hill slopes of only one and <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50s</span> of 112 and 133 MicroM for EMD 46152 and EMD 41000, respectively. In addition, maximal <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> was reduced at PM Ca2+ in comparison to 10 MicroM Ca2+.7. These data show that <span class=\"chem\">analogues</span> of sulmazole increase the PO of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> SR Ca2+-release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> and this occurs as the result of an increase in the frequency and duration of open events. They also demonstrate that the activation of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> by these drugs is not stereoselective and therefore the configuration of the oxygen atom or methyl group attached to the sulphur atom does not affect their ability to elicit their effect. Similarly, the results show that the nitrogen in the 4, 5b or 4, Sc position of the pyridine ring does not affect Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-independent activation of the Ca2+-release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. However, removal of the methylsulphinyl oxygen in sulmazole and isomazole results in two drugs which display a ten fold increase in <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> over their respective parent <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> in the activation of the Ca2+-release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>.

MTX and DXR exhibit antithetical activities toward RyR. Under conditions promoting <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> closure, DXR enhances the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of [3H]ryanodine (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 44 microM), whereas MTX has higher <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 25 microM) but > 10-fold lower activity towards activating RyR. Unlike DXR, MTX assayed under conditions promoting <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activation inhibits the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of [3H]ryanodine (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 3.3 microM) and does not alter the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> with which Ca++ activates RyR in the presence or absence of Mg++. In the presence of Mg++, MTX does not alter kobs and slows k-1 for [3H]ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>, whereas DXR accelerates kobs with little change in k-1. The antithetical behavior of MTX and DXR at the RyR raises the possibility that MTX antagonizes the ability of DXR to activate the RyR when the drugs are present in combination. In consonance with this hypothesis, MTX inhibits DXR (60 microM)-sensitized [3H]ryanodine-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> sites in a dose-dependent manner (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 8.4 microM) and shifts the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for DXR-activated [3H]ryanodine-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> without reducing the maximum occupancy attained at high DXR concentration, revealing the competitive nature of the interaction of DXR and MTX. MTX singly does not alter active Ca++ accumulation by SR but is shown to fully inhibit DXR-induced Ca++ release. The results suggest that MTX antagonizes DXR-activated RyR by <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to mutually exclusive sites and may provide a rational basis for combination therapy aimed at extending the current dose limits of DXR.</td>\n",

Aroclors with an intermediate weight percent of chlorine enhance by >6-fold the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of 1 nM[3H]ryanodine to its conformationally sensitive site on the SR Ca2+ -release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> [i.e., ryanodine receptor (RyR)] with high <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>=1.4 microM), whereas Aroclors with either high or low chlorine composition show little activity. Structure-activity studies with selected pentachlorobiphenyl congeners reveal a stringent structural requirement for chlorine substitution at the ortho-positions, with 2,2',3,5',6-pentachlorobiphenyl having the highest <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> toward skeletal and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> isoforms of RyR (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>=330 nM and 2 microM, respectively). In contrast, 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl does not enhance ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span>, suggesting that noncoplanarity of the biphenyl rings is required for <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activation. However, 2,2',4,6,6'-pentachlorobiphenyl is significantly less active toward RyR, suggesting that some degree of rotation about the biphenyl bond is required. 2,2',3,5',6-Pentachlorobiphenyl induces a dose-dependent release of Ca2+ from actively loaded SR vesicles with a maximum rate of 1.2 micromol mg-1 min-1 (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span>=1 microM), whereas 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (< / = microM) does not alter Ca2+ transport. The mechanism of PCB-induced <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activation involves a significant decrease in the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (20-fold and 100-fold, respectively). Neither 2,2',3,5',6- nor 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (< / = 10 microM) alters the activity of the skeletal isoform of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase or the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> isoform of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase, and PCB-induced Ca2+ release can be fully <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by either microM ryanodine or ruthenium red. These results are the first to demonstrate a selective ryanodine receptor-mediated mechanism by which ortho-substituted PCBs alter microsomal Ca2+ transport and may have toxicological relevance.</td>\n",

However, mRNA expression of oestrogen receptors in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> tissue of the adult <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> has yet to be demonstrated. Furthermore, a <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> action of 17beta-oestradiol on <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> tissue has been discussed. Therefore, two subjects were investigated in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes of the <span class=\"species\">human</span>, and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes of <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> and <span class=\"species\">rat</span> in this study. (1) Are oestrogen receptors expressed in adult <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> cells? (2) Is there an influence of oestrogens on the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes? Expression of oestrogen receptors was investigated by reverse polymerase chain reaction. <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current was usually measured by the <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> technique in whole-cell recording mode under selective recording conditions, i.e. overlapping currents were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span>. One series of experiments was performed in perforated patch configuration to avoid internal perfusion. 17beta-oestradiol inhibited <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> current reversibly in all three species. At 10(-5) M, the inhibition was 15-20%. This inhibition was independent of the sex and the species. A full concentration response curve of 17beta-oestradiol on basal <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> current was recorded from female <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> myocytes. The inhibition increased from 2% at 10(-7) M to about 30% at 10(-4) M 17beta-oestradiol. The values could be fitted by a sum of two sigmoidal functions with log <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> values of -6.5 and -4.9 M and Hill slopes of 2.5 for both. The specificity of the 17beta-oestradiol action was tested by recording the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> current in the presence of 17alpha-oestradiol and oestrone. 17alpha-oestradiol also inhibited the current, but with a maximal inhibition of only 17%. The concentration-response curve could be fitted by a single sigmoidal function (log <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> -6-3 M; Hill slope 0.55). Oestrone did not influence the current at all. The decrease in <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> current after the application of 17beta-oestradiol via a rapid perfusion system developed with a time constant of 3-4 s, which was in the same range as that for the influence of isoprenaline. The isoprenaline-stimulated <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> current was much more susceptible to the inhibition by 17beta-oestradiol, i.e. in pre-stimulated cells (1) the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect is significantly higher (e.g. at 10(-5) M, inhibition was 36.3% compared with 11.2% in untreated cells) and (2) an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect can be seen with oestradiol concentrations as low as 10(-9) M. Although the concentrations needed to gain a <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> influence on the basal current were much too high to explain a <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardio-protective</span> influence of oestrogens, the presence of oestrogen receptors in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> myocytes of all three species, together with the shift in concentration dependence following pre-stimulation by isoprenaline, suggest that myocytes are a potential <span class=\"calcium\">target</span> for oestrogen.</td>\n",

Under conditions of low trans Ca2+ (20 microM), increasing cis Ca2+ from 0.1 to 10 microM caused a gradual increase in <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> open probability (Po). Elevating cis Ca2+ above 100 microM resulted in a gradual decrease in Po. Elevating trans [Ca2+] enhanced <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity (<span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> approximately 2.5 mM at 1 microM cis Ca2+) primarily by increasing the frequency of <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> openings. The dependency of Po on trans [Ca2+] was similar at negative and positive holding potentials and was not influenced by high cytosolic concentrations of the fast Ca2+ chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N, N-tetraacetic acid. Elevated luminal Ca2+ enhanced the sensitivity of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> to activating cytosolic Ca2+, and it essentially reversed the inhibition of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> by high cytosolic Ca2+. Potentiation of Po by increased luminal Ca2+ occurred irrespective of whether the electrochemical gradient for Ca2+ supported a cytosolic-to-luminal or a luminal-to-cytosolic flow of Ca2+ through the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. These results rule out the possibility that under our experimental conditions, luminal Ca2+ acts by interacting with the cytosolic activation site of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> and suggest that the effects of luminal Ca2+ are mediated by distinct Ca2+-sensitive site(s) at the luminal face of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> or associated protein.</td>\n",

In this report, we show that Gd(3+) also inhibits ionic current (I(NaCa)), carried by the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger protein. Under selective recording conditions, Gd(3+) inhibited both outward and inward I(NaCa) from <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibition concentrations (IC(50)) of 30.0+/-4.0 microM at +60 mV (Hill-coefficient, h=1.04+/-0.13) and 20.0+/-2.7 microM at -100 mV (h=1.13+/-0.16), respectively (P>0.05, n=5 - 9). Thus, inhibition was not <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span>. The time from Gd(3+) application to steady-state effect was slow compared to the divalent <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> Ni(2+). The slow time course appeared to reflect gradual Gd(3+) accumulation at its <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site on the exchanger, rather than a <span class=\"effect\">use-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> mechanism. This study indicates that for experiments in which Gd(3+) is used, its <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect on I(NaCa) should be taken into account.</td>\n",

I(NCX) was recorded by ramp pulses from the holding potential of -60 mV in the presence of 140 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and 2 mM Ca(2+) in the external solution, and 20 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and 398 nM free Ca(2+) (19 mM Ca(2+) and 30 mM BAPTA) in the internal solution. External application of amiodarone suppressed I(NCX) in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC(50) value was 3.3 microM with a Hill coefficient of 1. Intracellular application of trypsin via the micropipette attenuated the <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effect of amiodarone, suggesting that amiodarone affects the cytoplasmic side of the <span class=\"chem\">molecule</span>. This <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of amiodarone on the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger may contribute to the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> action of the drug.</td>\n",

The effect of 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), a '<span class=\"chem\">chemical</span> phosphatase', on <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)/Ca(2+) exchange current (I(NCX)) was investigated using the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage-clamp</span> technique in single <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes and in CCL39 fibroblast cells expressing canine NCX1. 2. I(NCX) was identified as a current sensitive to KB-R7943, a relatively selective NCX <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, at 140 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and 2 mM Ca(2+) in the external solution and 20 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+) and 433 nM free Ca(2+) in the pipette solution. 3. In <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> cells, BDM inhibited I(NCX) in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC(50) value was 2.4 mM with a Hill coefficients of 1. The average time for 50% inhibition by 10 mM BDM was 124+/-31 s (n=5). 4. The effect of BDM was not affected by 1 microM okadaic acid in the pipette solution, indicating that the inhibition was not via activation of okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases. 5. Intracellular trypsin treatment via the pipette solution significantly suppressed the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of BDM, implicating an intracellular site of action of BDM. 6. PAM (pralidoxime), another oxime <span class=\"chem\">compound</span>, also inhibited I(NCX) in a manner similar to BDM. 7. Isoprenaline at 50 microM and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at 8 microM did not reverse the inhibition of I(NCX) by BDM. 8. BDM inhibited I(NCX) in CCL39 cells expressing NCX1 and in its mutant in which its three major phosphorylatable serine residues were replaced with alanines. 9. We conclude that BDM inhibits I(NCX) but the mechanism of inhibition is not by dephosphorylation of the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger as a '<span class=\"chem\">chemical</span> phosphatase'.</td>\n",

Using the whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> technique, the effect of aprindine on <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchange current (I(NCX)) was examined in <span class=\"species\">guinea-pig</span> single <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes and CCL39 fibroblasts expressing a <span class=\"species\">dog</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1). 2. I(NCX) was recorded by ramp pulses from the holding potential of -60 mV with the external solution containing 140 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ and 1 mM Ca2+, and the pipette solution containing 20 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+, 20 mM BAPTA and 13 mM Ca2+ (433 nM free Ca2+). 3. External application of aprindine suppressed I(NCX) in a concentration-dependent manner. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of outward (measured at 50 mV) and inward (measured at -100 mV) I(NCX) components were 48.8 and 51.8 microM with Hill coefficients of 1.3 and 1, respectively. 4. Intracellular application of trypsin via the pipette solution did not change the <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effect of aprindine, suggesting that aprindine does not affect the exchanger from the cytoplasmic side. 5. Aprindine inhibited I(NCX) of a mutant NCX1 with a deletion of amino acids 247 - 671 in the large intracellular domain between the transmembrane segments 5 and 6 in a similar manner to that of the wild-type, suggesting that the site of aprindine inhibition is not in the large intracellular domain of NCX1. 6. A kinetic study indicated that aprindine was cooperatively competitive with KB-R7943, another <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of NCX and that aprindine was a competitive <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> with respect to external Ca2+. 7. We conclude that aprindine may modestly inhibit I(NCX) in a therapeutic range of concentrations (around 2.5 approximately 6.9 microM) possibly at an external or intra-membranous site of the exchanger.</td>\n",

It is also a well-known stimulant that can produce adverse side effects, including <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>. Here, the action of caffeine on single RyR2 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in bilayers and Ca(2+) sparks in permeabilized <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> is defined. Single RyR2 caffeine activation depended on the free Ca(2+) level on both sides of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. Cytosolic Ca(2+) enhanced RyR2 caffeine <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span>, whereas luminal Ca(2+) essentially scaled maximal caffeine activation. Caffeine activated single RyR2 <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in diastolic quasi-cell-like solutions (cytosolic MgATP, pCa 7) with an EC(50) of 9.0 ± 0.4 mM. Low-dose caffeine (0.15 mM) increased Ca(2+) spark frequency ∼75% and single RyR2 opening frequency ∼150%. This implies that not all spontaneous RyR2 openings during diastole are associated with Ca(2+) sparks. Assuming that only the longest openings evoke sparks, our data suggest that a spark may result only when a spontaneous single RyR2 opening lasts >6 ms.</td>\n",

IC(50) (<span class=\"chem\">potency</span>) and maximum inhibition (efficacy) were calculated for each drug. Drugs fell into 3 distinct categories. Category 1 drugs (flecainide and R-<span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span>) suppressed wave parameters with the highest <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> (IC(50)<10 μM) and efficacy (>50% maximum wave inhibition). Category 2 drugs (encainide, <span class=\"chemicals\">quinidine</span>, lidocaine, and <span class=\"chemicals\">verapamil</span>) had intermediate <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> (IC(50) 20-40 μM) and efficacy (20-40% maximum wave inhibition). Category 3 drugs (procainamide, disopyramide, mexiletine, <span class=\"chemicals\">cibenzoline</span>, and ranolazine) had no significant effects on Ca(2+) waves at the highest concentration tested (100 μM). <span class=\"chemicals\">Propafenone</span> was stereoselective, with R-<span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> suppressing waves more potently than S-<span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> (IC(50): R-<span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> 2 ± 0.2 μM vs. S-<span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> 54 ± 18 μM). Both flecainide and R-<span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> decreased Ca(2+) spark mass and converted propagated Ca(2+) waves into non-propagated wavelets and frequent sparks, suggesting that reduction in spark mass, not spark frequency, was responsible for wave suppression. Among all class I <span class=\"effect\">antiarrhythmic</span> drugs, flecainide and R-<span class=\"chemicals\">propafenone</span> inhibit Ca(2+) waves with the highest <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> and efficacy. Permeabilized casq2-/- myocytes are a simple in-vitro assay for finding drugs with activity against Ca(2+) waves. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Possible Editorial'.</td>\n",

This study investigated KB-R7943 inhibition of hERG (<span class=\"species\">human</span> ether-à-go-go-related gene) K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> that underpin the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> rapid delayed rectifier potassium current, I(Kr) . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> measurements were made of hERG current (I(hERG) ) carried by wild-type or mutant hERG <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> and of native <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> I(Kr) . Docking simulations utilized a hERG homology model built on a MthK-based template. KEY RESULTS: KB-R7943 inhibited both I(hERG) and native I(Kr) rapidly on membrane depolarization with IC(50) values of ∼89 and ∼120 nM, respectively, for current tails at -40 mV following depolarizing voltage commands to +20 mV. Marked I(hERG) inhibition also occurred under <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> action potential <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span>. I(hERG) inhibition by KB-R7943 exhibited both time- and voltage-dependence but showed no preference for inactivated over activated <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Results of alanine mutagenesis and docking simulations indicate that KB-R7943 can bind to a pocket formed of the side chains of aromatic residues Y652 and F656, with the <span class=\"chem\">compound</span>'s nitrobenzyl group orientated towards the cytoplasmic side of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> pore. The structurally related NCX <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> SN-6 also inhibited I(hERG) , but with a markedly reduced <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: KB-R7943 inhibits I(hERG) /I(Kr) with a <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> that exceeds that reported previously for acute <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> NCX inhibition. Our results also support the feasibility of benzyloxyphenyl-containing NCX <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> with reduced potential, in comparison with KB-R7943, to inhibit hERG.</td>\n",

Recently, however, TTX has been shown to <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca²⁺ current (I(Ca)) in canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> cells. In the present study, the TTX-sensitivity of I(Ca) was studied in isolated canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes as a function of (1) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> phosphorylation, (2) extracellular pH and (3) the redox potential of the bathing medium using the whole cell <span class=\"assays\">voltage clamp</span> technique. Fifty-five micromoles of TTX (IC₅₀ value obtained under physiological conditions) caused 60% ± 2% inhibition of I(Ca) in acidic (pH = 6.4), while only a 26% ± 2% <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> in alkaline (pH = 8.4) milieu. Similarly, the same concentration of TTX induced 62% ± 6% suppression of ICa in a reductant milieu (containing glutathione + ascorbic acid + dithiothreitol, 1 mM each), in contrast to the 31% ± 3% <span class=\"other_terms\">blockade</span> obtained in the presence of a strong oxidant (100 μM H₂O₂). Phosphorylation of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> protein (induced by 3 μM forskolin) failed to modify the inhibiting <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of TTX; an IC₅₀ value of 50 ± 4 μM was found in forskolin. The results are in a good accordance with the predictions of our model, indicating that TTX binds, in fact, to the selectivity filter of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">Ca channels</span>.</td>\n",

CE-WIB801C dose-dependently inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation, and its <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value was 175 μg/ml. CE-WIB801C increased cAMP level more than cGMP level, but inhibited collagen-elevated [Ca(2+)]i mobilization and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> Rp-8-Br-cAMPS increased the CE-WIB801C-downregulated [Ca(2+)]i level in a dose dependent manner, and strongly inhibited CE-WIB801C-induced inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) phosphorylation. These results suggest that the inhibition of [Ca(2+)]i mobilization by CE-WIB801C is resulted from the cAMP/A-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of IP3R. CE-WIB801C suppressed TXA2 production, but did not inhibit the activities of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and TXA2 synthase (TXAS). These results suggest that the inhibition of TXA2 production by WIB801C is not resulted from the direct inhibition of COX-1 and TXAS. In this study, we demonstrate that CE-WIB801C with cAMP-dependent Ca(2+)-<span class=\"other_terms\">antagonistic</span> antiplatelet effects may have preventive or therapeutic potential for platelet aggregation-mediated diseases, such as thrombosis, <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> infarction, atherosclerosis, and ischemic cerebrovascular disease.</td>\n",

Noradrenaline potently inhibited IKss (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 0.90 nM, 42.1 ± 4.3% at 1 µM, n = 7) and potentiated the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> Ca(2+) current (ICaL, <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 136 nM, 205 ± 40% at 1 µM, n = 6). Noradrenaline-sensitive IKss was weakly <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span>, time-independent, and potentiated by the <span class=\"chemicals\">arachidonic acid</span> <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span>, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (EYTA; 10 µM), or by osmotically induced membrane stretch. Noise analysis revealed a unitary conductance of 8.4 ± 0.42 pS (n = 8). The biophysical/pharmacological properties of IKss indicate a TREK-like K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. The effect of noradrenaline on IKss was abolished by combined β1-/β2-adrenoceptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonism</span> (1 µM <span class=\"chemicals\">propranolol</span> or 10 µM β1-selective atenolol and 100 nM β2-selective ICI-118,551 in combination), but not by β1- or β2-<span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> alone. The action of noradrenaline could be mimicked by β2-agonists (zinterol and fenoterol) in the presence of β1-<span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>. The action of noradrenaline on IKss, but not on ICaL, was abolished by pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment. The action of noradrenaline on ICaL was mediated by β1-adrenoceptors via a PTX-insensitive pathway. Noradrenaline prolonged APD30 by 52 ± 19% (n = 5; P < 0.05), and this effect was abolished by combined β1-/β2-<span class=\"other_terms\">antagonism</span>, but not by atenolol alone. CONCLUSION: Noradrenaline inhibits a <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> TREK-like K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> current via a PTX-sensitive mechanism involving co-operativity of β1-/β2-adrenoceptors that contributes to <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> APD prolongation.</td>\n",

The slowly activating delayed rectifier K(+) (I(Ks)) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> is a <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> composed of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits. The C terminus of the KCNQ1 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> protein has two calmodulin-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> sites that are involved in regulating I(Ks) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of gintonin-mediated activation of <span class=\"species\">human</span> I(Ks) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity by expressing <span class=\"species\">human</span> I(Ks) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in Xenopus oocytes. We found that gintonin enhances IKs <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> currents in concentration- and <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> manners. The <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for the I(Ks) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> was 0.05 ± 0.01 μg/ml. Gintonin-mediated activation of the I(Ks) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> was <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by an LPA1/3 receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, an active phospholipase C <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, an IP3 receptor <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, and the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> chelator BAPTA. Gintonin-mediated activation of both the I(Ks) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> was also <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by the calmodulin (CaM) <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> calmidazolium. Mutations in the KCNQ1 [Ca(2+)]i/CaM-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> IQ motif sites (S373P, W392R, or R539W)<span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> the action of gintonin on I(Ks) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. However, gintonin had no effect on hERG K(+) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity. These results show that gintonin-mediated enhancement of I(Ks) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> currents is achieved through <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of the [Ca(2+)]i/CaM complex to the C terminus of KCNQ1 subunit.</td>\n",

External application of W-7 and trifluoperazine inhibited <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca exchange current in a dose-dependent manner with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of 13 and 7 microM, respectively. W-5 inhibited the exchange current but less potently than W-7. More specific calmodulin <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> such as CGS 9343B and calmidazolium did not, however, decrease the current as significantly as expected. All these drugs inhibited the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> current more strongly than the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca exchange current. Ruthenium red (RR), another type of calmodulin <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, did not decrease the exchange current by internal application. Neither mastoparan or melittin (calmodulin-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> peptides) inhibited the exchange current appreciably. RR and the peptides did not affect the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> current either. These results indicate that calmodulin may not involved in the activation of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca exchange or the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> current. Internal application of chymotrypsin inhibited the <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effect of W-7 on the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca exchange current but not that on the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> current. These results indicate that W-7 <span class=\"other_terms\">blocks</span> the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca exchange current not by <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to calmodulin but possibly by directly affecting an internal site of the exchanger itself and that the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> action of W-7 is different on the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>/Ca exchange current and the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span> current.</td>\n",

Y. (1988) Pflügers Arch 411:132-136, 371-377; (1992) Pflügers Arch 421:1-6]. This study was performed to examine the sensitivity of SR Ca(2+)-release <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> to ryanodine in fetal compared to adult <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span> and to investigate the influence of Ca2+, caffeine, and Mg2+ on ryanodine depression in skinned fibers. Ryanodine (0.3 nM-1 microM) caused a dose-dependent depression in skinned <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> fibers of the <span class=\"species\">rat</span>, and the fetal fibers (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> approximately 74 nM) were 26-fold less sensitive than those of the adult (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> approximately 2.9 nM). The depression induced by 0.1 microM or 1 microM ryanodine was a function of [caffeine], or [Ca2+] (pCa < 6.0), which was potentiated by caffeine, and an inverse function of [Mg2+]. At pCa > 8.0 plus 25 mM caffeine, a 20% ryanodine depression was observed in both the fetal and adult fibers, indicating independence from Ca2+. Ryanodine depression in skinned fibers of the fetus was less affected than that seen in the adult by pCai, [caffeine]i, or 25 mM caffeine plus pCai or plus pMgi (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> approximately pCa 4.5 versus 5.1; caffeine 12.7 mM versus 2 mM; pCa 6.7 versus 7.3; and pMg 3.9 versus 3.3 respectively). The results show that the SR Ca(2+)-release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> in both fetal and adult <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardium</span> is modulated by Ca2+, caffeine, and Mg2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</td>\n",

Non-specific <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> was defined in the presence of <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span> 10(-5) mol litre-1, and bound and free radioactivity were separated by vacuum filtration. The effects of local anaesthetics were determined by <span class=\"chem\">displacement</span> of [3H]PN200-110 (approximately 0.2 nmol litre-1), a radiolabelled 1,4- <span class=\"chemicals\">dihydropyridine</span> (DHP) L-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>. The concentration of displacer producing 50% <span class=\"chem\">displacement</span> was corrected for the competing mass of [3H]PN200-110 to yield the <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> constant, K50. All local anaesthetics displaced [3H]PN200-110 in a dose-dependent manner with a rank order <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> of (K50, mmol litre-1) bupivacaine (0.48), amylocaine (0.74), lignocaine (1.09), prilocaine (2.06) and procaine (2.09). Ropivacaine enantiomers did not show stereo-selective <span class=\"chem\">displacement</span>, with K50 values of 0.99 and 0.92 mmol litre-1 for R(+) and S(-) ropivacaine, respectively. There was a significant correlation between pK50 and p (octanol:buffer partition coefficient) (r2 = 0.872, P = 0.020), pK50 and p (local anaesthetic <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>) (r2 = 0.816, P = 0.036), pK50 and p (relative conduction <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> <span class=\"chem\">potency</span>) (r2 = 0.843, P = 0.028) and between pK50 and p (<span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> for inhibition of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> output) (r2 = 0.897, P = 0.015). These data suggest that DHP <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> sites may be involved in both the mechanism of local anaesthesia and the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiotoxicity</span> of these agents.</td>\n",

The purpose of this study was to test whether the sulfonylurea glibenclamide might also inhibit other types of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> Cl- <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Whole-cell <span class=\"assays\">patch-clamp</span> techniques were used to compare the effects of glibenclamide on CFTR Cl- currents in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes, swelling-activated Cl- currents in <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> myocytes, and Ca(2+)-activated Cl- currents in canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. Glibenclamide markedly inhibited CFTR Cl- currents in a voltage-independent manner at 22 degrees C, with estimated <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values of 12.5 and 11.0 mumol/L at +50 and -100 mV, respectively. The outwardly rectifying swelling-activated Cl- current in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells was less sensitive to glibenclamide, and the <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> exhibited voltage dependence. At 22 degrees C, the estimated <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values were 193 and 470 mumol/L at +50 and -100 mV, respectively, and <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> was enhanced at 35 degrees C. Macroscopic Cl- currents activated by a rise in intracellular Ca2+, induced by either Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release or by external application of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, were also markedly inhibited at 22 degrees C by glibenclamide in a voltage-independent manner. The estimated <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values were 61.5 and 69.9 mumol/L at +50 and -100 mV, respectively. These results suggest that glibenclamide, an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> CFTR Cl- <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, also inhibits swelling-activated and Ca(2+)-activated Cl- <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> at higher concentrations.

Single <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> measurements were carried out in symmetric 0.25 m KCl media using the planar lipid bilayer method. BDM (1-10 mm) activated suboptimally Ca2+-activated (0.5-1 microM free Ca2+) single, purified and native <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> and skeletal release <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> in a concentration-dependent manner by increasing the number of <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> events without a change of single <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> conductances. BDM activated the two <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> isoforms when added to either side of the bilayer. At a maximally activating cytosolic Ca2+ concentration of 20 microM, BDM was without effect on the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>, whereas it inhibited skeletal <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activities with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> approximately 2.5 mm. In agreement with single <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> measurements, high-<span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> [3H]ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to the two <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> isoforms was increased in a concentration-dependent manner at </=1 microM Ca2+. BDM was without a noticeable effect at low (</=0.01 microM) Ca2+ concentrations. At 20 microM Ca2+, BDM inhibited the skeletal but not <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. These results suggest that BDM regulates the Ca2+ release <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> muscle in a concentration, Ca2+ and tissue-dependent manner.</td>\n",

Mitochondrial dysfunction, secondary to excessive accumulation of Ca2+, has been implicated in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> injury. We here examined the action of potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> openers on mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis, as these <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">modulators</span> have recently been shown to <span class=\"calcium\">target</span> a mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. 2. In isolated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> mitochondria, diazoxide and pinacidil decreased the rate and magnitude of Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondrial matrix with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 65 and 128 microM, respectively. At all stages of Ca2+ uptake, the potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> openers depolarized the mitochondrial membrane thereby reducing Ca2+ influx through the potential-dependent mitochondrial uniporter. 3. Diazoxide and pinacidil, in a concentration-dependent manner, also activated release of Ca2+ from mitochondria. This was prevented by <span class=\"chemicals\">cyclosporin A</span>, an <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of Ca2+ release through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. 4. Replacement of extramitochondrial K+ with mannitol abolished the effects of diazoxide and pinacidil on mitochondrial Ca2+, while the K+ ionophore valinomycin mimicked the effects of the potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> openers. 5. ATP and ADP, which <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> K+ flux through mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, inhibited the effects of potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> openers, without preventing the action of valinomycin. 6. In intact <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span>, diazoxide also induced mitochondrial depolarization and decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ content. These effects were inhibited by the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> 5-hydroxydecanoic acid. 7. Thus, potassium <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> openers prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ overload by reducing the driving force for Ca2+ uptake and by activating cyclosporin-sensitive Ca2+ release. In this regard, <span class=\"other_terms\">modulators</span> of an ATP-sensitive mitochondrial K+ conductance may contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis.</td>\n",

Ca(2+) inactivation occurs with an IC(50) value of about 3.7 mM for RyR1, but RyR2 shows little inactivation, even at >100 mM Ca(2+). In an attempt to localize the low <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> Ca(2+) <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> sites responsible for Ca(2+) inactivation in RyR1, chimeric RyR1/RyR2 <span class=\"chem\">molecules</span> were constructed. Because [(3)H]ryanodine binds only to open <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, and because <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> opening and closing are Ca(2+)-dependent, the Ca(2+) dependence of [(3)H]ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> was used as an indirect measurement of Ca(2+) release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> opening and closing. IC(50) values for [(3)H]ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> suggested that Ca(2+) <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> for the low <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> Ca(2+) inactivation sites was unchanged in a chimera in which a glutamate-rich sequence (amino acids 1743-1964) in RyR1 was replaced with the corresponding, less acidic sequence from RyR2. Ca(2+) <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> (IC(50)) for low <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> Ca(2+) inactivation sites was intermediate in RyR1/RyR2 chimeras containing RyR2 amino acids 3726-4186 (RF9), 4187-4628 (RF10), or 4629-5037 (RF11), was closer to RyR2 values in RyR1 chimeras with longer RyR2 replacements (RF9/10 or RF10/11), and was indistinguishable from RyR2 in RyR1 containing all three RyR2 replacements (RF9/10/11). These data suggest that multiple low <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> Ca(2+) <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> sites or multiple components of a low <span class=\"chem\">affinity</span> Ca(2+) <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site are located between amino acids 3726 and 5037 and that their effects on Ca(2+) inactivation of the release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> are cooperative. Measurement of Ca(2+) activation of [(3)H]ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> showed that chimeras RF10, RF9/10, and RF9/10/11 were more sensitive to Ca(2+) than was either RyR1 or RyR2. Measurement of caffeine activation of Ca(2+) release in vivo showed that chimeras RF9, RF10, RF9/10, RF10/11, and RF9/10/11 were more sensitive to caffeine than wild-type RyR1.

Such overload is due at least in part to the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, we investigated whether dantrolene, a <span class=\"other_terms\">blocker</span> of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>, may protect from ischemic injury. In <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> experiments, we determined the effect of dantrolene on [3H]-ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> in <span class=\"species\">rat</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> tissue. In perfusion experiments, isolated <span class=\"species\">rat</span> hearts were perfused for 20 min in the working mode, in the presence of 0-45 microM dantrolene. The hearts were then subjected to 30 min of global ischemia and 120 min of retrograde reperfusion. Tissue injury was evaluated on the basis of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and LDH release. The <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> experiments showed that dantrolene displaced 4 nM [3H]-ryanodine with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 34 microM. In the perfusion experiments, tissue necrosis (i.e., TTC-negative tissue) averaged 28.3 +/- 1.6% of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> mass under control conditions. Dantrolene was protective at micromolar concentrations: tissue necrosis decreased to 21.4 +/- 1.0% and 8.4 +/- 1.4% with 1 microM and 45 microM dantrolene, respectively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Similar results were obtained with regard to LDH release. At low concentrations (up to 4 microM), dantrolene did not produce any significant hemodynamic effect, except for a slight increase in coronary flow, whereas at higher concentration a negative <span class=\"effect\">inotropic</span> effect was apparent. In conclusion, dantrolene reduced ischemic injury even at concentrations that did not affect contractile performance. Modulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release might represent a new <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> strategy.</td>\n",

I(NCX) was recorded by ramp pulses from the holding potential of -60 mV in the presence of 140 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ and 1 mM Ca2+ in the external solution and 20 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+ and 119 nM free Ca2+ (7 mM Ca2+ and 20 mM BAPTA) in the internal solution. <span class=\"chemicals\">Bepridil</span> suppressed I(NCX) in a concentration-dependent manner. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value was 8.1 microM with a Hill coefficient of 0.8. Intracellular treatment with trypsin via the pipette solution attenuated the <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> effect of <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span>, suggesting that the <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> site is on the cytosolic side of the <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+/Ca2+ exchanger. In the absence of albumin in the external solution, 10 microM <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> inhibited I(NCX) by 46+/-7% (n = 8), while <span class=\"chemicals\">bepridil</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> it by 28+/-8% (n = 6) in the presence of albumin. <span class=\"chemicals\">Bepridil</span> inhibited I(NCX) in a supra-therapeutic concentration range.</td>\n",

The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), however, may prevent <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>. To test the effect of PUFAs on the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> NCX1 current (I(NCX1)), the canine NCX1 cDNA was expressed in <span class=\"species\">human</span> embryonic kidney (HEK293t) cells. The average density of I(NCX1) was 10.9+/-2.6 pA/pF (n=44) in NCX1-transfected cells and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3) significantly inhibited I(NCX1) The suppression of I(NCX1) by EPA was concentration-dependent with an <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> of 0.82+/-0.27 microM. EPA had a similar effect on outward or inward I(NCX1). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3) and <span class=\"chemicals\">arachidonic acid</span> (AA, C20:4n-6) also significantly inhibited I(NCX1), whereas the saturated fatty acid, stearic acid (SA, C18:0), did not. Our data demonstrate that the n-3 PUFAs significantly suppress <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> I(NCX1), which is probably one of their protective effects against lethal <span class=\"effect\">arrhythmias</span>.</td>\n",

Crisps are two domain proteins with a structurally similar yet evolutionary diverse N-terminal domain and a characteristic cysteine-rich C-terminal domain, which we refer to as the Crisp domain. We presented the NMR solution structure of the Crisp domain of <span class=\"species\">mouse</span> Tpx-1, and we showed that it contains two subdomains, one of which has a similar fold to the ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> regulators BgK and ShK. Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time that the ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> regulatory activity of Crisp proteins is attributed to the Crisp domain. Specifically, the Tpx-1 Crisp domain inhibited <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ryanodine receptor (RyR) 2 with an IC(50) between 0.5 and 1.0 microM and activated the skeletal RyR1 with an AC(50) between 1 and 10 microM when added to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. This activity was nonvoltage-dependent and weakly <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span>, respectively. Furthermore, the Tpx-1 Crisp domain activated both RyR forms at negative bilayer potentials and showed no effect at positive bilayer potentials when added to the luminal domain of the receptor. These data show that the Tpx-1 Crisp domain on its own can regulate ion <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> activity and provide compelling evidence for a role for Tpx-1 in the regulation of Ca(2+) fluxes observed during sperm capacitation.</td>\n",

The INCX was recorded by ramp pulses with a holding potential of -60 mV using a pipette solution containing 226 nM free Ca2+ (20 mM 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and 10 mM Ca2+) and 20 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+. The external solution contained 140 mM <span class=\"sodium\">Na</span>+, 1 mM Ca2+, and <span class=\"other_terms\">blockers</span> of other currents and pumps such as Cs+, <span class=\"chemicals\">nifedipine</span>, ryanodine, and ouabain. A selective potent NCX <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, KB-R7943 (100 microM), was used to completely inhibit INCX. Dronedarone inhibited INCX in a concentration-dependent manner. The <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> values for the outward and inward INCX inhibition were about 33 and 28 microM, respectively, with the Hill coefficient of 1 for both. The <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effect of dronedarone at 50 microM on INCX did not change in the presence of trypsin in the pipette solution. Therefore, dronedarone is classified as a trypsin-insensitive NCX <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> and distinct from amiodarone which is a trypsin sensitive. We conclude that dronedarone inhibits INCX but the <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> is tenfold less than that of amiodarone. Dronedarone may modestly inhibit INCX in a therapeutic concentration range.</td>\n",

External application of <span class=\"chemicals\">azimilide</span> suppressed bi-directional I(NCX) in a concentration-dependent manner. IC(50) values for outward and inward I(NCX) were 45 and 40 µM, respectively, with Hill coefficients of 1. <span class=\"chemicals\">Azimilide</span> attenuated I(NCX) in the presence of trypsin in the patch pipette, indicating that <span class=\"chemicals\">azimilide</span> is a trypsin-insensitive NCX <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>. Delayed afterdepolarization induced by electrical stimulation with ouabain disappeared in the presence of 30 µM <span class=\"chemicals\">azimilide</span>. We conclude that <span class=\"chemicals\">azimilide</span> inhibits NCX at supratherapeutic concentrations.</td>\n",

Tetracaine has been extensively used to study the role of the SR Ca(2+) fluxes in muscle cells, yet a detailed understanding of tetracaine action on RyR <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> is lacking. Here we investigate tetracaine effects in single <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> recording of sheep <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> RyRs in lipid bilayers. Tetracaine decreased <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> conductance (<span class=\"other_terms\">block</span>) and open probability (inhibition). The IC(50) for inhibition had complex dependencies on membrane voltage and cytoplasmic [ATP], [Ca(2+)] and pH. We identify three mechanisms underlying these actions. First, a <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span>, slow inhibition in which luminal and cytoplasmic tetracaine compete for a common neutral/cation <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> site within the trans-membrane RyR domain to induce long closed events (~100 ms). The apparent <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> rate is proportional to the RyR closed probability, indicating that it only operates on closed <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Second, a voltage-independent, pH sensitive fast inhibition in which cytoplasmic and luminal tetracaine compete for a site located on the cytoplasmic domain of the RyR to induce fast closed events (~2 ms). Its IC(50) is not dependent on the open/closed conformation of RyR. Finally, a <span class=\"effect\">voltage-dependent</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> by cytoplasmic tetracaine reduced <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> conductance. We develop a model for tetracaine inhibition which predicts that under diastolic conditions, i.e. when RyRs are mainly closed, the slow mechanism has the highest <span class=\"chem\">potency</span> (IC(50)~200 μM) of the three mechanisms and is therefore the dominant form of inhibition. However, during periods of Ca(2+) release, i.e. when RyRs are open, the slow mechanism becomes ineffective, leaving the fast inhibition (IC(50)~2 mM) as the dominant effect. Because of this closed state inhibition property, tetracaine loses its efficacy when RyRs open. This has the effect of increasing the feedback on SR Ca(2+) release generated by cytoplasmic and luminal Ca(2+).</td>\n",

CE-WIB801C dose-dependently inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and its <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> value was 18.5 μg/mL. CE-WIB801C decreased TXA2 production, but did not inhibit the activities of COX-1 and thromboxane synthase (TXAS) in ADP-activated platelets, which suggests that the inhibition of TXA2 production by CE-WIB801C is not resulted from the direct inhibition of COX-1 and TXAS. CE-WIB801C inhibited ATP release and [Ca(2+)]i mobilization, and increased cAMP level and IP3RI (Ser(1756)) phosphorylation in ADP-activated platelets. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> Rp-8-Br-cAMPS increased CE-WIB801C-inhibited [Ca(2+)]i mobilization, and strongly inhibited CE-WIB801C-increased IP3RI (Ser(1756)) phosphorylation. CE-WIB801C elevated the phosphorylation of VASP (Ser(157)), an A-kinase substrate, but inhibited fibrinogen <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to αIIb/β3. These results suggest that CE-WIB801C-elevated cAMP involved in IP3RI (Ser(1756)) phosphorylation to inhibit [Ca(2+)]i mobilization and, VASP (Ser(157)) phosphorylation to inhibit αIIb/β3 activation. Therefore, in this study, we demonstrate that CE-WIB801C may have a preventive or therapeutic potential for platelet aggregation-mediated diseases, such as thrombosis, <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">myocardial</span> infarction, atherosclerosis, and ischemic cerebrovascular disease.</td>\n",

Compared to control SR, actively loaded SR from animals exposed to a single intravenous dose of doxorubicin exhibit faster rates of doxorubicin-induced Ca2+ release and the occupancy of [3H]ryanodine is significantly enhanced with subsequent exposure of SR membranes to doxorubicin in vitro. One week after acute exposure to doxorubicin in vitro, the <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> for activation of the <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> of [3H]ryanodine by Ca2+ is not significantly different from control SR. However, the persistence of doxorubicin-sensitized SR <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> appears to be latent since repeated exposure to doxorubicin in vitro significantly enhances receptor occupancy in SR obtained from the treated rats compared to control SR. Ryanodine receptors from rats chronically exposed to doxorubicin consistently exhibit a higher sensitivity to activation Ca2+ which persists at least 4 weeks following the last injection of drug. Chronic exposure produces a concomitant reduction in the capacity of [3H]ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> sites. The marked decrease in receptor density observed with SR from doxorubicin-treated rats coincides with significant reduction in body weight, suggesting a possible influence of nutrition. However, <span class=\"sodium\">sodium</span> dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis indicates no significant loss of the high molecular weight subunit of the ryanodine receptor, suggesting that loss of [3H]ryanodine-<span class=\"chem\">binding</span> capacity may be the result of progressive and permanent <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> desensitization. Consistent with desensitized receptors, membrane vesicles prepared from rats chronically exposed to doxorubicin take up significantly more Ca2+ and exhibit significantly reduced rates of doxorubicin or Ca2+/ryanodine induced Ca2+ release. The data demonstrates (i) doxorubicin inflicts cumulative SR <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> lesions in vivo, (ii) a persistent sensitization of the SR <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> to activation by Ca2+ and (iii) a significant and apparently irreversible reduction in the number of functional <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> complexes.</td>\n",

We investigated subcellular mechanisms for Ca(2+)-induced enhancement of IK in large-pipette inside-out membrane patches excised from isolated <span class=\"species\">guinea pig</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> myocytes. When [Ca2+]i was raised from 10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/L, the amplitude of IK measured at +80 mV was increased from 12.0 +/- 2.2 to 19.5 +/- 3.3 pA (P < .01). The enhancement of IK by Ca2+ was dose dependent, with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> of 3.8 x 10(-8) mol/L. A calmodulin <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span>, W7 (50 mumol/L), calmidazolium (100 mumol/L), or HT-74 (20 mumol/L), added to the intracellular solution abolished enhancement of IK by Ca2+, whereas the inactive form of the W7 <span class=\"chem\">analogue</span>, W5, had no effect on IK. In the presence of a protein kinase <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> with a relatively high specificity for protein kinase C (H7), for protein kinase A (H8 or peptide-type <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> PKI), or for calmodulin kinase II (KN-62) or a nonspecific <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of serine/threonine protein kinases (staurosporine), increases in [Ca2+]i still enhanced IK. Ca(2+)-induced enhancement of IK was also observed when Mg2+ and ATP were omitted from the intracellular solution to delete exogenous phosphate donors and when adenylylimidodiphosphate was added to preclude trapped cytoplasmic substrates. Thus, <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> IK was enhanced by increases in [Ca2+]i at a physiological range via a calmodulin-dependent pathway, which did not involve a phosphorylation process.</td>\n",

[(3)H]ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> assays revealed a K(d)value of; 2.5 n M for all investigated <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> tissues. Bound [(3)H]ryanodine was Ca(2+)-dependent with similar <span class=\"IC50s\">EC(50)</span>values of 0.43, 0.49 and 0.79 microM for <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>, canine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricle</span> and ovine <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>, respectively. However the density of <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> sites was 4.5 times lower in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> than in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> tissues. Beyond the presence of selective K(+)<span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> (gamma=188 pS) recorded in the SR enriched fraction of <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrium</span>, the activity of a large conducting (gamma=671 pS) cationic <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> was also observed. The latter displayed typical characteristics of Ca(2+)-release <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> which were activated by 10 microM free [Ca(2+)] and 2 m M ATP. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of the RyR2 isoform in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> and <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> samples whereas no immunoreactivity was detected with specific RyR1 and RyR3 antibodies. Our results, obtained at the molecular level, are consistent with the presence of functional SR in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> cells. The <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> Ca(2+)-release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> displays <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> and regulating properties typical of the RyR2 isoform.</td>\n",

Upon <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to the Ca(2+) release <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> (ryanodine receptor), ryanodine causes two major changes in the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>: a reduction in single-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> conductance and a marked increase in open probability. The molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the gating behavior and Ca(2+) dependence of the wild type (wt) and a mutant <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> ryanodine receptor (RyR2) after being modified by ryanodine. Single-<span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> studies revealed that the ryanodine-modified wt RyR2 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> was sensitive to inhibition by Mg(2+) and to activation by caffeine and ATP. In the presence of Mg(2+), the ryanodine-modified single wt RyR2 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> displayed a sigmoidal Ca(2+) dependence with an EC(50) value of 110 nm, whereas the ryanodine-unmodified single wt <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> exhibited an EC(50) of 120 microm for Ca(2+) activation, indicating that ryanodine is able to increase the sensitivity of the wt RyR2 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> to Ca(2+) activation by approximately 1,000-fold. Furthermore, ryanodine is able to restore Ca(2+) activation and <span class=\"chem\">ligand</span> response of the E3987A mutant RyR2 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> that has been shown to exhibit approximately 1,000-fold reduction in Ca(2+) sensitivity to activation. The E3987A mutation, however, affects neither [(3)H]ryanodine <span class=\"chem\">binding</span> to, nor the stimulatory and <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects of ryanodine on, the RyR2 <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span>. These results demonstrate that ryanodine does not \"lock\" the RyR <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> into an open state as generally believed; rather, it sensitizes dramatically the <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> to activation by Ca(2+).</td>\n",

However, the mechanism of <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotection</span> remains controversial. We measured rhod-2 fluorescence in adult <span class=\"species\">rabbit</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">ventricular</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> as an index of mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](m)), using time-lapse confocal microscopy. To simulate ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), cells were exposed to metabolic inhibition (50 minutes) followed by washout with control solution. Rhod-2 fluorescence gradually increased during simulated ischemia and rose even further with reperfusion. The mitoK(ATP) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> opener diazoxide attenuated the accumulation of [Ca(2+)](m) during simulated I/R (EC(50)=18 micromol/L). These effects of diazoxide were <span class=\"other_terms\">blocked</span> by the mitoK(ATP) <span class=\"calcium\">channel</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">antagonist</span> 5-hydroxydecanoate (5HD). In contrast, <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitors</span> of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), <span class=\"chemicals\">cyclosporin A</span> and bongkrekic acid, did not alter [Ca(2+)](m) accumulation during ischemia, but markedly suppressed the surge in rhod-2 fluorescence during reperfusion. Measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential, DeltaPsi(m), in permeabilized myocytes revealed that diazoxide depolarized DeltaPsi(m) (by 12% at 10 micromol/L, P<0.01) in a 5HD-inhibitable manner. Our data support the hypothesis that attenuation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, as a consequence of partial mitochondrial membrane depolarization by mitoK(ATP) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>, underlies <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotection</span>. Furthermore, mitoK(ATP) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> and the MPT differentially affect mitochondrial <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> homeostasis: mitoK(ATP) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> suppress <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> accumulation during I/R, while the MPT comes into play only upon reperfusion.</td>\n",

This study investigated Ca(2+ )sensitivity of tension and myosin-ATPase activity in skinned fiber preparations of male and female wildtype (WT; n = 12) and transgenic mice with a <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> specific overexpression of the Galphaq-protein (Galphaq-OE; n = 11). In addition, the phosphorylation status of troponin I was measured. Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension was increased in Galphaq-OE with a significant reduction in the half-maximum Ca(2+) concentration (EC(50)) compared to WT. Similarly, Ca(2+) sensitivity of myosin ATPase activity was increased in Galphaq-OE when comparing Galphaq-OE to WT. Maximum Ca(2+)-dependent tension and ATPase activity were both enhanced in Galphaq-OE compared to WT littermates. Phosphorylation of troponin I was significantly reduced in Galphaq-OE compared to WT. In the above experiments, no gender specific differences were observed in either Gaq-OE or in WT. We conclude that, in mice, increased expression of the Galphaq-protein induces alterations of myofibrillar function and energy consumption, which are also characteristics of <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> failure. This may result from a decreased phosphorylation of troponin I in Galphaq-OE.</td>\n",

METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a quantitative in vitro motility assay. With donor <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> troponin, Ca(2+) sensitivity is two- to three-fold higher when TnI is unphosphorylated. In the myectomy samples from patients with HOCM, the mean level of TnI phosphorylation was low: 0.38 ± 0.19 mol Pi/mol TnI compared with 1.60 ± 0.19 mol Pi/mol TnI in donor hearts, but no difference in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity was observed. Thus, troponin regulation of thin filament Ca(2+) sensitivity is abnormal in HOCM hearts. HOCM troponin (0.29 mol Pi/mol TnI) was treated with protein kinase A to increase the level of phosphorylation to 1.56 mol Pi/mol TnI. No difference in EC(50) was found in thin filaments containing high and low TnI phosphorylation levels. This indicates that Ca(2+) sensitivity is uncoupled from TnI phosphorylation in HOCM <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> troponin. Coupling could be restored by replacing endogenous troponin T (TnT) with the recombinant TnT T3 isoform. No difference in Ca(2+) sensitivity was observed if TnI was exchanged into HOCM <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> troponin or if TnT was exchanged into the highly phosphorylated donor <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> troponin. Comparison of donor and HOCM <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> troponin by mass spectrometry and with adduct-specific antibodies did not show any differences in TnT isoform expression, phosphorylation or any post-translational modifications. CONCLUSION: An abnormality in TnT is responsible for uncoupling myofibrillar Ca(2+) sensitivity from TnI phosphorylation in the septum of HOCM patients.</td>\n",

This study characterises for the first time the <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span>-dependent chloride <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> (CaCC) in the plasma membrane of primary <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">atrial</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> fibroblasts by means of the iodide efflux and the <span class=\"assays\">patch clamp</span> methods. The <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> ionophore A23187 and Angiotensin II (Ang II) activate a chloride conductance in <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> fibroblasts that shares pharmacological similarities with <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span>-dependent chloride <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. This chloride conductance is depressed by RNAi-mediated selective Anoctamine 1 (ANO1) but not by Anoctamine 2 (ANO2) which has been revealed as CaCC and is inhibited by the selective ANO1 <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span>, T16inh-A01. The effect of Ang II on anion efflux is mediated through AT1 receptors (with an <span class=\"IC50s\">EC50</span> = 13.8 ± 1.3 nM). The decrease of anion efflux by calphostin C and bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM I) suggests that chloride conductance activation is dependent on PKC. We conclude that ANO1 contributes to CaCC current in <span class=\"species\">human</span> <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiac</span> fibroblasts and that this is regulated by Ang II acting via the AT1 receptor pathway.</td>\n",

Flocalin and tioflocalin caused moderate Ca(2+)-independent mitochondria swelling, which was prevented by a specific <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of 5-hydroxydecanoate. This allowed to identify these <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> as mitochondrial K(ATP)-<span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> openers. We found that concentration-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) of flocalin (with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 50 microM) and tioflocalin (with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 2,7 microM) on Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling (MPTP opening) in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> characterized more powerful <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> action of the latter. It was shown that the administration of these <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> in experiments in vivo decreased the sensitivity of the MPTP opening to Ca2+. Thus, under physiological conditions the activators K(ATP)-<span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> probably provide the membrane-stabilizing effects, thereby effectively increasing the organelles resistance to Ca2+, an inductor of MPTP. The results obtained allowed to characterize the role of the <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> studied as <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotectors</span> and regulators of the MPTP formation in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>, indicated their anti-ischemic and anti-apoptotic effects that can be used in order to correct the mitochondrial dysfunction under pathological conditions of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> system.</td>\n",

The mechanisms of apoptosis and necrosis were investigated under influence of ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> activation and in conditions of <span class=\"other_terms\">blocking</span> of the <span class=\"calcium\">L-type</span> <span class=\"calcium\">calcium</span> (VGCCs) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span>. Flocalin was added in the culture medium in the dose 5 and 20 microM at 2 minutes before anoxia (30 minutes) and following reoxygenation (60 minutes). These doses are near to: the first dose means the opening of K(ATP) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> and the second one means the <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> <span class=\"other_terms\">block</span> of VGCCs. It is discovered that in dose 5 microM of flocalin drew the change of correlation of living, necrotizing and apoptizing cells drew side-shifting living. The number of live cells was almost the same like in control (experiments without anoxia-reoxygenation modelling). The opening of K(ATP) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> decreases necrosis in two times and fully prevented development of apoptosis which was induced anoxia-reoxygenation modelling. Flocalin depressed the apoptosis of neonatal <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> so that he was on to 36% less than in control group (without anoxia-reoxygenation).

Thus, small doses of flocalin, that induce moderate opening of K(ATP) <span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> significantly decrease the number of necrotic and apoptotic cells in culture of <span class=\"species\">rat</span> neonatal <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiomyocytes</span> induced by anoxia-reoxygenation.</td>\n",

Flocalin and tioflocalin caused moderate Ca(2+)-independent mitochondria swelling, which was prevented by a specific <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitor</span> of 5-hydroxydecanoate. This allowed to identify these <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> as mitochondrial K(ATP)-<span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> openers. We found that concentration-dependent <span class=\"other_terms\">inhibitory</span> effects (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) of flocalin (with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 50 microM) and tioflocalin (with <span class=\"IC50s\">IC50</span> = 2,7 microM) on Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling (MPTP opening) in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span> characterized more powerful <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotective</span> action of the latter. It was shown that the administration of these <span class=\"chem\">compounds</span> in experiments in vivo decreased the sensitivity of the MPTP opening to Ca2+. Thus, under physiological conditions the activators K(ATP)-<span class=\"calcium\">channels</span> probably provide the membrane-stabilizing effects, thereby effectively increasing the organelles resistance to Ca2+, an inductor of MPTP. The results obtained allowed to characterize the role of the <span class=\"chem\">compound</span> studied as <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardioprotectors</span> and regulators of the MPTP formation in the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">heart</span>, indicated their anti-ischemic and anti-apoptotic effects that can be used in order to correct the mitochondrial dysfunction under pathological conditions of the <span class=\"interesting_tissue\">cardiovascular</span> system.</td>\n",
